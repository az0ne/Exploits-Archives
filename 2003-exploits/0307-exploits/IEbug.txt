Hi,
I found a bug in IE6 ón Windows XP with all Service Packs and Patches installed:
If you enter C:\aux in the adressline of the IE (not EXPLORER, InternetExplorer)
and hit enter, the window will freeze. This bug is simmilar to C:\con\con
but not as dagerous. But its the same reason, naimly that windows trys to
open aux, a hardware device in earlier windows versions.
I already sended an email to Microsoft but they said the bug wouldn't exist.

Bye
