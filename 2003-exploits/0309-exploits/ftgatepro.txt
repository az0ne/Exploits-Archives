FTGatePro Mail Server 1.x

DESCRIPTION:
Two vulnerabilities have been identified in FTGatePro allowing
malicious users to access sensitive information.

1) It is possible for malicious users to see the configuration for
FTGatePro. This may be done by making a HTTP request for
"/tools/ftgatedump.fts?command=1" from the web admin interface.

2) It is possible for a malicious user with access to FTGatepro and
the local system to see all usernames and passwords. This may be done
by making a HTTP request for "/tools/exportmbx.fts", a local file
containing the information will then be created.

This has been reported to affect version 1.2 build 1331.

SOLUTION:
Reportedly, the vulnerabilities have been fixed in version 1.2 build
1335.

Only allow trusted users to access FTGatePro and the local system.
