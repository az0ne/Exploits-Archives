Release Date: 09/22/2003

TITLE
=====
Savant Web Server - Remote DoS

DESCRIPTION
===========
"Savant is a full-featured open source / freeware web
server designed to be run under any 32-bit version of
Microsoft Windows (including Windows 95, 98, ME, XP,
NT, and 2000).  Savant was designed to be easy to use,
fast, and secure."

More information at http://savant.sourceforge.net

PROBLEMS
========
Affected Version	: Savant Web Server 3.1(latest)
and probably older builds.
Tested Platform		: Windows 2000 Professional.

Savant Web Server is suffered from multiple remote DoS
vulnerabilities which let an attacker to terminate the
daemon by sending a malformed request to the server.

DETAILS
=======

By sending GET request such as /%x /%f /%I /%n etc...
to Savant Web Server, the service will crash with a
dialog box popped up saying "invalid memory
reference". Examining the Savant general log files,
you will see the index.html keeps redirecting to
itself, hence causing an infinite loop until the http
service could not handle the requests and crashed. 

GET 
/%h/index.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.htmlindex.html"
301 412

That's all for now folks!!! *yawn*

VENDOR STATUS
=============
I haven not gotten any reply from the vendor (and this
software hasn't been updated for a while), so my best
suggestion to Savant's users is either disable Savant
on your computer and wait for a newer release or just
simply switch to another stable and secure Web Server.
