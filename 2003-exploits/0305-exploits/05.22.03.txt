Authentication Bypass in iisPROTECT
May 22, 2003

I. BACKGROUND

iisPROTECT is designed to provide password protection to web
directories similar to the htaccess method utilized by the Apache
Software Foundation's HTTP web server.  More information about
iisPROTECT is available at http://www.iisprotect.com .

II. DESCRIPTION

Upon successful installation and implementation of iisPROTECT, users
will be presented with a login and password dialog box when
attempting to access files contained in a protected directory.
Consider the following example:

http://iisprotected.example.com/protected/secret.html

An attacker can bypass this authentication by simply requesting the
same file through different URL-encoded representations. Examples of
these include but are not limited to:

http://iisprotected.example.com/%70rotected/secret.html
http://iisprotected.example.com/protected%2fsecret.html

III. ANALYSIS

Any remote attacker can exploit the above-described vulnerability to
bypass the access control restrictions imposed by iisPROTECT, thereby
exposing potentially sensitive files and information.

IV. DETECTION

iisPROTECT 2.1 and 2.2 are vulnerable. Previous versions may be
vulnerable as well.

V. VENDOR FIX/RESPONSE

iisPROTECT has released version 2.2.0.9 to fix this vulnerability.
The latest version is available at www.iisprotect.com .

VI. CVE INFORMATION

The Mitre Corp.'s Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Project
has assigned the identification number CAN-2003-0317 to this issue.
