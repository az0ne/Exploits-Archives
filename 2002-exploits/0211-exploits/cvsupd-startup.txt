Hi,

Better not to file a PR for this, I feel.

I was just passing by net/cvsup-mirror/files/cvsupd.sh when I noticed that
it appends to the fixed-name file /var/tmp/cvsupd.out

Therefore if I were a malicious user, I could make a symlink of that
name in /var/tmp to effect arbitrary file corruption.  If
I was really clever, I might point it at /root/.ssh/authorized_keys and
use secondary means to get cvsupd's output to include my public key.

Consider changing it to /var/log/cvsupd.out ?

Regards,
Joshua.
