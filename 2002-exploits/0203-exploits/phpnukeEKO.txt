// PHP Nuke 5.X ?  Path disclosure vuln through modules.php by Patryk K. (echo7)  //

PHP Nuke can expose full Path beginning with root dir 
Which can be used to plan further attack against a Vulnerable 
website, Disposing Information as such can give attacker idea
how badly PHP nuke processes calls devried from php-nuke system

here's example

http://example.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=0&file=0

will return:

Warning: Failed opening 'modules/0/0.php' for inclusion (include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php')
in /users/thisuser/example.com/modules.php on line 23




I didn't have enough time to play around with it so i decided to 
post it as it is, also where name=0 the 0 will show in path so I guess
PHP code insertion would work ?

If you have comments questions email me :)

Solution :

php-nuke developers should have some patches coming :)
