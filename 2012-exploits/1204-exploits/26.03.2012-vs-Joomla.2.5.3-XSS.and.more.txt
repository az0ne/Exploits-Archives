[ 1. What is this?
This is very nice CMS, You should try it! ;)

[--------------------------------------------[
[ 2. What is the type of vulnerability?
This is reflected cross-site scripting. The same way attacker can use to get information
about localization of Your installed Joomla.

Try to send to your-joomla normal HTTP GET to any link You'll choose.
This is no matter. But change default 'localhost' or similar string 
and send Your XSS-payload via this header.

In the same way we can get path/to/cms.

Enjoy.

[--------------------------------------------[
[ 3. Where is bug :)

'Host' header. (Because value from this header is used after request in HTML. :)
