[ 2. What is the type of vulnerability?
Information disclosure. Normal user can add 'wrong input' to forms, and thats
how he find out what is Your Joomla* location.

[ 3. Where is bug :)
Its just an example, there are more info-disclo bugs in this component. Anyway:

Go to: http://joomla/index.php/en/component/jnews/ to 'Search' something You want.
At 'search' form type '. 

Thats all. For vulnerable php.ini You should see something like:
"Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in 
/home/kuba/www/joomla/administrator/components/com_jnews/classes/class.mailing.php on line 70

Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #1 is not an array in 
/home/kuba/www/joomla/administrator/components/com_jnews/classes/frontend.php on line 1667"

Vulnerable parameter is 'emailsearch'.
