Vuln Description:
As i noted above this script is commercial and that's why today i'm unable(may be lazy) to show you whereis vulnerability.
I discovered this vulnerability while owning armenian sites.
Flaw in that if the remote user is not authenticated against admin panel ( somesite.tld/sitedb/admin/ )
it seems script (after session checking thing) is unable to properly kill it's execution.
Since i have no access to source code of this script i'll try to imagine how this process goes:


Suppose:

<?php
session_start();

if (!isset($_SESSION['am_i_admin_or_am_i_logged_in_admin'])) echo "<script>self.location='login.php';</script>";

/*
Notice:
echo 'JS_REDIRECTION';
 **        not  **
die('JS_REDIRECTION');
*/





/****** PWNED ********/
//YOU ARE ADMIN HERE//
?>


Exploitation is simple like 2x2:

Disable javascript in your browser and follow to: site.tld/sitedb/admin/admin.php
(If you wonder then press CTRL+U you will see somethink like:

<script> self.location='login.php';</script>
<script> self.location='login.php';</script>
)



Demo: http://www.videosmate.com/componentdemo/sitedb/admin/admin.php          (<=Disable javascript in your browser or use  NoScript then surf there)



This is not end!! 111))
