Hello
The latest versions of CKFinder (2.3) and FCKEditor(2.6.8) are accepting SWF as a valid extension. As a result, it is possible to make a website vulnerable to an XSS attack by uploading a malicious SWF file.

This has been reported to the vendor today, but the swf file is public currently via my blog.
