[ 1. What is this?
This is very nice CMS, You should try it! ;)

[--------------------------------------------[
[ 2. What is the type of vulnerability?
Reflected cross-site scripting.

(* ..., because I think this could be extended to attack
with 'non-visible button'. ;))

[ 3. Where is bug :)

When You are logged-in as a normal user, You can add post to forum.
You can add title (parameter "subject") of Your post only with 85 characters.
And that's the trick, because error displayed to user (if 'subject' is > 85 chars)
can contain XSS code.

Try to add Ax85+"><xss><

Screens from attack You can see at my blog.
