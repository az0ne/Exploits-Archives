Introduction:
=============
NextGEN Gallery is the most popular photo gallery plugin for WordPress, and one of the most popular WordPress plugins 
of any kind with over 5 million downloads. It provides a powerful engine for uploading and managing galleries of images, 
with the ability to batch upload, import meta data, add/delete/rearrange/sort images, edit thumbnails, group galleries into 
albums, and more. It also provides two front-end display styles (slideshows and thumbnail galleries), both of which come 
with a wide array of options for controlling size, style, timing, transitions, controls, lightbox effects, and more.
NextGEN Gallery is now proudly maintained by Photocrati Media. Special thanks to Alex Rabe who created and maintained the 
plugin from 2007 through 2011.

Status:
========
Published


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Medium


Details:
========
Multiple non persistent cross site scripting vulnerabilities are detected in the NextGEN Gallery v1.9.5 Wordpress Application Addon.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to hijack website customer, moderator or admin sessions with medium or high required user inter 
action. The bugs are located on server side in the general option module with the bound vulnerable gallery path parameter request. 
Successful exploitation can result in wordpress application account steal, client side phishing & client-side content request manipulation. 
Exploitation requires low or medium user inter action & with privileged web application user account.

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] General Options

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] Gallery path


Proof of Concept:
=================
The persistent vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers with low required user inter action & low privileged 
application user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Inject the following example string to the application input (persistent) or parameter (client side)
String:  >"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com></iframe>


Review: General Options - Gallery path

<tr valign="top">
<th align="left">Gallery path</th>
<td><input size="35" name="gallerypath" value="asd" <[PERSISTENT INJECTED SCRIPT CODE!]="" 


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the persistent input validation vulnerabilities are estimated as medium.
