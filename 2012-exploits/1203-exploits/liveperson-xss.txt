When you use google dorks click on "If you like, you can repeat the
search with the omitted results included."

Well, yeah, we can see Cross Site Scripting in LivePerson.

What is LivePerson?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LivePerson

Today I spoke with tech support and asked who uses the LivePerson:

The fact that we currently have over 8,500 clients, including many
Fortune 500 companies such as Verizon, Adobe, Cisco, Estee Lauder,
Home Depot, Neiman Marcus, Panasonic, Bank of America, Chase, HSBC,
Microsoft, HP, IBM, Hoovers and Citibank, is testimony to the quality
of service, security and support we provide our customers. (c) Support
