Abstract:
=========
The Vulnerability Laboratory Research Team discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the mobile MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 app for the apple ipad & iphone.


Report-Timeline:
================
2013-02-13:	Public Disclosure


Status:
========
Published


Affected Products:
==================
Apple AppStore
Product: MyFi Wireless Disk 1.2


Exploitation-Technique:
=======================
Remote


Severity:
=========
Critical


Details:
========
1.1
A local file include web vulnerability via POST request method is detected in the mobile MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers via POST method to inject local app webserver folders to request unauthorized local webserver files.

The vulnerbility is located in the upload file module of the webserver (http://192.168.0.10:80) when processing to upload a file with manipulated 
`filename` parameter. The execution of the injected path or file request will occur when the attacker is processing to reload to index listing 
of the affected module.

Exploitation of the web vulnerability does not require a privileged application user account (standard) or user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unauthorized path or file access via local file or path include attack.


Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Upload File

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] filename

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Dir - Index Listing

 

1.2
A local command injection web vulnerability is detected in the mobile MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows to inject local commands via vulnerable system values to compromise the apple mobile application.

The vulnerbility is located in the index module when processing to load the ipad or iphone device name. Local attackers can 
change the ipad or iphone device name to system specific commands and file/path requests to provoke the execution when processing 
to watch the index listing.

Exploitation of the web vulnerability requires a local privileged device user account (standard) without user interaction.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results unauthorized execution of system specific commands or file/path requests.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Index

Vulnerable Parameter(s):
				[+] device name - iPad or iPone

Affected Module(s):
				[+] Application Header - Index Listing


1.3
A cross site request forgery web vulnerability is detected  in the mobile MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 app for the apple ipad & iphone.
The vulnerability allows remote attackers to form manipulated links or scripts to execute application functions when processing to 
load client side requests in the web browser.

The vulnerability is located in the application delete module and the not secure parsed file parameter. Remote attacker can force 
application users with not expired session to execute application function when processing to click a manipulated link.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires medium or high user interaction without privileged application user account.
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability result in account steal via client side session hijacking, client site phishing, or 
client-side content request manipulation.

Vulnerable Application(s):
				[+] MyFi Wireless Disk v1.2 - ITunes or AppStore (Apple)

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] Delete

Vulnerable Module(s):
				[+] file

Affected Module(s):
				[+] File Dir - Listing


Proof of Concept:
=================
1.1
The local File/Path Include web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attacker without required application user account 
(no password: standard) and also without user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Local Path Include Vulnerability

PoC:
POSTDATA =-----------------------------249872938427813
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; 
filename="[INJECTED FILE OR PATH REQUEST]<.png"
Content-Type: image/png   --- ÿØÿà

Reference(s):
http://192.168.0.10/upload


1.2
The command injection web vulnerability can be exploited by local attackers with required device application user account and with 
low user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Command Injection via Devicename

1.3
The client side cross site request forgery web vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers without application user account 
and with medium or high required user interaction. For demonstration or reproduce ...

Risk:
=====
1.1
The security risk of the file include web vulnerability is estimated as critical because of no standard password protection.

1.2
The security risk of the local command injection vulnerability via device name is estimated as high(-).

1.3
The security risk of the client side cross site request forgery web vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
