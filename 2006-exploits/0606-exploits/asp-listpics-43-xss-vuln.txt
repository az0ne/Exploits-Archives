RETRO-CREDITS
=============
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by
Donnie Werner of exploitlabs. At the original time
of discovery and retro-release date, the author was
not aware of any other advisories or patches available.

Retro-Advisories are released when either the same research
is released by a 3rd party, old private research that is no longer
active, or the product has been patched due to Vendor updates
before a formal Exploitlabs advisory was released to the public.
