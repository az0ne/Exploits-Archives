 print_r(unserialize('a:1073741823:{i:0;s:30:"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"}'));
?>

in function zend_hash_init() int overflow ( ecalloc() )-> heap overflow
here segfault in zend_hash_find() but it's possible to fake the bucket and
exploit a zend_hash_del_index_or_key
i tried a memory dump , just fake the bucked with the pointer of the
$GLOBALS's bucket but segfault before in memory_shutdown...

don't cry a river :P
ethic is for gayz
