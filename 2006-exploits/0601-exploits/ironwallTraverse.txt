IronWall webserver 7.41 directory traversal


[-
## Software ##

App: IronWall Webserver
Version: 7.41 estable (others not tested)
Platform: win32


## Background ##

Ironwall webserver is a small web server for win32 systems.
It can be downloaded totally free at softonic/tucows, and their devels seems
to be out of order.


##  Vulns ##

1.- If its installed with default options, it shows any file in any drive of
the computer where is installed,
because there is no root path already defined.

Sample:
http://www.server.com/path/to/file.ext

This is not a bug, but it's a big security problem.

2.- When root path is defined, you still have access to full drives. Just
add 3 or more dots (...) as path
in the url. This set the drive where installed as root path, and gives
access to every files.

Sample:
http://www.server.com/...../path/to/file.ext
