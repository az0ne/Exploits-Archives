II. Synopsis

There is an unsanitized $tabls variable that allows for SQL injection
in to the DROP
query from the dropbase.php file.  This causes the script to become
un-opperational
until the table has been fixed or until the application has been
reinstalled.  The vendor
has been made aware of this situation and has fixed the issue.  Please
upgrade to the
latest version.

Example:
