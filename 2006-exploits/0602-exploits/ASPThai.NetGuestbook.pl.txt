I MurderSkillz from g00ns.net found a vuln "SQL Injection Exploit for
ASPThai.Net Guestbook <=3D 5.5 and POSSIBLY higher" The sql injection takes
place in admin.asp. IF injected with special characters into the login it
will grant u with admin..BUT we wrote wrote some code to grab plaintext use=
r
and pass..here is the code


#!/usr/bin/perl
# SQL Injection Exploit for ASPThai.Net Guestbook <=3D 5.5

# Bug Found by muderskillz Coded by Zodiac
