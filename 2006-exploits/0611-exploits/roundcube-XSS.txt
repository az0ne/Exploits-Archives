There is an XSS vulnerability in roundcube webmail:

http://demo.roundcube.net/?_task=');alert(%22XSS%22)//

Btw, we've been posting 0-day XSS vulnerabilities at 
http://sla.ckers.org/forum/list.php?3 to take it out of the full 
disclosure list since lots of people don't want to see the sheer volume 
of reports.  We've got close to a thousand companies and counting.  
We're just trying to cut down on the noise to people's inboxes.  That is 
all.
