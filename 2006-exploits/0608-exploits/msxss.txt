Hello,

I have found that microsoft.com fails to filter html properly on some pages.

http://support.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.aspx?lang=en&cr=US&dg=microsoft.public.ccf&sloc=us');alert('xss<http://support.microsoft.com/newsgroups/default.aspx?lang=en&cr=US&dg=microsoft.public.ccf&sloc=us%27%29;alert%28%27xss>

this causes javascript to be executed when a user clicks the help link.
Someone knows how to get js executed on page load?

greets,
Thomas
