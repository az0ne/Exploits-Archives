sat collegeboard site sql injection vulnerability

they even show you the query to be nice

to get your question of the day:
http://www.collegeboard.com/apps/qotd/question/0,,47992,00.html

<!--
    SELECT s.question, ls.name, ls.description, s.content_id, s.hint
    FROM survey s, lk_survey ls
    WHERE s.lk_survey_id = ls.lk_survey_id
    AND s.content_id = 47992
-->

and the  s.content_id is directly controllable

http://www.collegeboard.com/apps/qotd/question/0,,(47992),00.html
<!--
    SELECT s.question, ls.name, ls.description, s.content_id, s.hint
    FROM survey s, lk_survey ls
    WHERE s.lk_survey_id = ls.lk_survey_id
    AND s.content_id = (47992)
-->


they do some naive filtering of quotes but you'll quickly find the bypass have PHUN and teachers live those kids alone
