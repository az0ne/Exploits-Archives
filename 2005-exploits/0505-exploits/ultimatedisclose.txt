Subject:
" Ultimate Forum  Password Database Vulnerability "


Vulnerable version:
Ultimate Forum 1.0




Description:
Ultimate forum is an Open forum i.e. no logon restrictions or private areas.
Forum is a text file based. Each forum is multithreaded and stored in a separate 
text file in the folder db/Forums. All of the forum management should be done via 
administration page ìadmin.aspî.





Vulnerability:
The application has stored database for Administration  on the directory called
'db/',uses filetype .DAT extention as 'Genid.DAT'.The credentials are stored encrypted 
in another text file "Genid.dat".A vulnerability on this application
that make password can be take by browser(download),then use program encryption
to descrypt the password/username .The password and username was encrypted and 
save it as 'Genit.DAT'.


Sample source:

(..)
EncryptUserID = CryptText(name, "$u@gess", False)
	EncryptPassword = CryptText(pass, "$u@gess", False)
	passFile = server.mappath("db\Genid.dat")
(..)


Here a vulnerable Administration Database;

passFile = server.mappath("db\Genid.dat")

Execute URL 'http://localhost/db/Genit.dat',then we go to download files
,use notepad to open file;


User name :
÷§‘Œ·‹óÈ≤»Ÿ‚Â     <-------
                         |
Password :               |
Â°⁄ÿÍ‚ñŸ          <------|
			 |
     ---------------------
     |
     |
     ------ > 'Open 'Genid.dat' at directory 'db' ,
then use SEDT tools to sure descrypt for the files 'Genit.dat'




Solution:
Modify or rename "db\Genid.dat" to another name,sample:
(..)
EncryptUserID = CryptText(name, "$u@gess", False)
EncryptPassword = CryptText(pass, "$u@gess", False)
passFile = server.mappath("db\Genid.dat")'A vulnerable line
'server.mappath("db\Genid.dat") modify to 'server.mappath("somepage\filename.dat")
(..)
Other else change string "$u@gess" is a crypt key. Change it at your will. 
But make sure it's the same on the "commit.asp" page.
