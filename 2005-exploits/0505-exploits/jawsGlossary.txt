TECHNICAL INFO
================================================================

The Glossary gadget doesn't filter dangerous characters in the argument 
view or ViewTerm ( according to the version)
allowing the instertion of items from 
"<script>alert(document.cookie)</script> to more complex situations.

Example:

v0.5.x:
http://url.com/index.php?gadget=Glossary&action=ViewTerm&term=<script 
src=some script</script>
v 0.4:
http://url.com/index.php?gadget=Glossary&action=view&term=<script 
src=some script></script>


An attacker may leverage this issue to have arbitrary script code 
executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user.
This may facilitate the theft of cookie-based authentication credentials 
as well as other attacks.
