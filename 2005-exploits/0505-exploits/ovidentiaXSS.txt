Ovidentia is a project which allows you to publish with extreme ease
and very fast an intranet, extranet or internet portal with the
classic functions of a Content Management System (CMS). Its website is
at http://www.ovidentia.org

Ovidentia suffers from a vulnerability which allows you to embed XSS
code such as
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
as part of the Subject line when starting a new thread in an unlocked
forum section.
