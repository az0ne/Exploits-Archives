Hello!

The next, non-commercial, technological Security Forum will take place
on Sunday, the 10th of April, 2005, at Tel Aviv University's Lev
Auditorium.

Schedule
--------
17:45 - Gathering - hot and cold drinks will be served.

18:00 - Amichai Shulman, CTO - Imperva.
   Lecture: Advanced SQL Injection Techniques.
   Level: High.

   The presentation will discuss and demonstrate some advanced SQL
   injection techniques that allow an attacker to circumvent popular
   protection mechanisms. Among the methods that will be discussed are
   "Blind Folded SQL Injection" and a number of evasion techniques.

19:00 - We will break for a short recess, as well as for
   refreshments and networking between members - hot and cold
   drinks will be served.

19:20 - Shalom Carmel.
   Lecture: Security vulnerabilities of the AS/400 platform.
   Level: Medium.

   The AS/400, also known as iSeries, is a midrange server manufactured
   by IBM. It is used predominantly for business applications. There are
   between 2000 and 3000 servers in Israel, and they can be found in
   banks, insurance companies, health providers (kupot holim), and
   manufacturing firms.

   In this talk we will overview the security challenges that rise in
   plugging an AS/400 server into a TCP/IP network, and we will look at
   some previously unpublished attacks involving AS/400.

Hot and cold drinks will be freely available.

Attendance is free.
