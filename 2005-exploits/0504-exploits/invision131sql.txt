Patch info
**************
A patched version of the vulnerable file can be found at, =
http://www.digitalparadox.org/memberlist.txt=20
Just replace /uploads/sources/memberlist.php with this, and it will be =
fixed.

A simple patch can be,

In /uploads/sources/memberlist.php on Line 274 add this code=20
                                   [CODE BEGINS]

                          if (!is_numeric($this->first)) {
                          $this->first =3D "0";
                          }

                                      [CODE ENDS]

So it should finally look like,
                                   [CODE BEGINS]

                $this->output .=3D $this->html->Page_header( array( =
'SHOW_PAGES' =3D> $links) );

                //-----------------------------
                // START THE LISTING
                //-----------------------------
                          if (!is_numeric($this->first)) {
                          $this->first =3D "0";
                          }

                $DB->query("SELECT m.name, m.id, m.posts, m.joined, =
m.mgroup, m.email,m.title, m.hide_email, m.location, m.aim_name,=20
m.icq_number,
                                   me.photo_location, me.photo_type, =
me.photo_dimensions

                                      [CODE ENDS]
