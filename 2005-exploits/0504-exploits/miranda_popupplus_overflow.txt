Miranda Instant Messenger is application that provides several messenger
services like ICQ, MSN, IRC etc.
One of Mirandas' widely used plugins (PopUp Plus), is vulnerable to a buffer
overflow condition.
While the option "Use SmileyAdd Setting" is enabled on the application menu
(Popups > Plus), a remote attacker could trigger the buffer overflow by
sending
roughly 530 characters as an instant message. EIP gets overwritten at 523
chars exactly.
The affected version of the plugin is 2.0.3.8, prior versions may also be
vulnerable. 
I tried to get a vendor response (zazoo), however the mail bounced.
