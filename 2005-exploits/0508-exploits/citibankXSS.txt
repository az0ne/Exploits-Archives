Hi Full-Disclosure,
I'm here to report an XSS vulnerability in one of Citibank's websites.
I actually found this at a log in screen, but it's on an obscure sub domain=
=20
so I don't beleive that much cookie stealing can be done from it.
Phishing, however, oh good lord yes. The phishing possbilities for this XSS=
=20
vulnerability are immense (did I mention the site was SSL'd?).

Anyway, I informed citibank through e-mail (no response), posted it on my=
=20
blog (no response, no fix..) and now I'll post it here.
I've had luck on FD in contacting BankOfAmerica employees in the past, so=
=20
maybe there are a few Citibank admins listening? Let's hope so.

Here's the URL:

de=3D1&countrycode=3D<HTML
GOES HERE>&servicecode=3Dsignon&TS=3D1119807930296

And here's an outline (+screenshot) for if/when they fix it:
