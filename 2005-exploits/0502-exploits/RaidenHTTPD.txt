2. The bug:
------------

The program by default has some checks to avoid malicious patterns
like "/../" into http requests, but the program doesn't well manage
the initial "/" into requests. In fact if you send a request like:

> GET /somefile HTTP/1.1

the webserver will return the requested file if available in the
DocumentRoot directory.


But if you send a request like:

> GET somefile HTTP/1.1

the webserver will return the requested file if available in the
disk partition where the httpd is installed.

3. The code:
-------------

To test the vulnerability, send a raw http request to the server like:

GET windows/system.ini HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost


this will display Windows' system.ini, if the http server is installed
on the same partition of Windows.
