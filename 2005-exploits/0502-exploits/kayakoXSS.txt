Vendor notified by their access log files (and this email to their sales st=

Keeping this short and sweet since XSS vulns aren't that big of a deal=20
to find, even still.  Clients login with cookies with a "remember me"=20
check box.  I thought it was at least significant because of what "nav"=20
is for.  The "nav" value is inserted as a subheading of the main page=20
node, and one website I saw this at inserted html code with a link in=20
the nav argument.  Nice.  One of those "double take" moments.  This XSS=20
was used as a "feature", leveraged by a customer: a hosting company.  I=20
was in awe.  They should simply know better.  So should Kayako.

Now, let's see how fast Kayako can release a security bulletin to their=20
customers.  Isn't a security audit a part of every release?

No fix yet, since the code is proprietary.  I always release fixes for=20
free software / open source code.  I can't do that with proprietary=20
code, though.

Cheers,

Seth

P.S.  Vendors have burned me and their users in the past for not fessing=20
up or giving credit where due; I agree with Linus Torvalds, vendor-sec=20
and ideas like it are a bad idea:

"I happen to believe in openness, and vendor-sec does not. It's that=20
simple." ( http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3458961 )
