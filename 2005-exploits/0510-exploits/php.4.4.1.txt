Hello,

Here under some stuff to dos apache + php just through an htaccess.

* With .htaccess method :

If you have into your php.ini -> safe_mode = On

Simply put a .htaccess file on the root directory of your website
with this content :

php_value session.save_path /var/www/somewherehowexist

Apache segfault with :

[Fri Sep 30 10:33:11 2005] [notice] child pid 17743 exit signal 
Trace/breakpoint trap (5)

There was a bug in the apache2handler SAPI, sapi_apache2.c file, that 
made this segfault here possible, the bug now is fixed upstream and 
5.1.0 final, 4.4.1 final and the next 5.0.X release will have the patch.

Also work with session.save_path into a VirtualHost.


Gentoo bug report :
