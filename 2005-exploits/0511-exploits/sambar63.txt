Discussion
=========

Sambars's server is multifaceted server with many threads. Versiosn of
Sambar Server 6.3 BETA 2 is vulenrable to the cross-site scriptings in
proxy configuration in admin console. Authentications are required to
get at the vulnerability, but once so, inject script breaks off in the
big structure of proxy.asp in many fields because of no delicate input
sifting.

SAMBARS/sysadmin/servers/proxy.asp

place in the big field of  Remote Proxy Server or Proxy Filter IPs and send.

"><script>alert("PWND")</script>

becous proxy config remembers settings it will be stored perisentce
vector XSS for getting at you later.

Workaround: use strong passwords for admin and don't let lo priv
users configure proxy config.

Inmportant geetz:
