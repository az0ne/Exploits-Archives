Bug
===

Firefox has caching problem, as a result of that someone can 
spoof a certificate of any website and use it as his/her own.
The problem is exploited using onunload inside  < body> and 
redirection using Http-equiv Refresh metatag,document.write()
and document.close()

First you direct the redirection metatag to the website 
of which you want to spoof the certificate, then inside 
the < body> tag you add onulnoad script so you can control
the output inside the webpage with the spoofed certificate.

After that you say to firefox, as soon as you unload this page 
close the stream, aparently the stream you close is 
the one of the redirection's website, you do that with 
document.close().

Now you can write anything you want , you do that 
using document.write(). After writing the content of you choice
you close the stream again , usually firefox wont display your content,
although if you check the source code you see it , so the last thing 
is to refresh the new page (do that using window.location.reload()), 
after that you have your domain name in the url field , your content 
in the browser and the magic yellow Lock on the bottom left corner, 
if you pass your mouse over it you will see displayed the name of 
the website you spoofed the certificate, if you double click on it you 
will check full information of the certificate without any warning !

You dont need to have SSL in your website ! it will work with 
http.

<TITLE>Spoofer< /TITLE>
<META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="0;URL=https://www.example.com">

 	          <h3>It is Great to Use Example's Cert!');

document.close();
