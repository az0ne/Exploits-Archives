So in this case "Google Mail Checker Plus" version 1.1.7 (2010-02-10)
has a flaw that allow attackers to make XSS style attacks.

All extensions runs over his origin and no have way to altered data
from extension or get sensitive data like , email account or password
etc..

if we look how many users have instaled this extension =>
https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/gffjhibehnempbkeheiccaincokdjbfe
303,711 users have instaled it (WoW)

############
explanation
############

Google Mail Checker Plus allows users to view wen they have a new mail and
view a preview of the mail ....

if a attacker compose a new mail with html or javascript code in
subject form field and send it to victim´s the code is executed wen
Victim´s click in the extension to view the mail and wen victim´s
accept the alert and view a preview of mail the iframe is executed
too.

Gmail is a safe place , but the extension to manage it can be a potential
vector to attack it.

For example send a email With a logout acction in gmail in subject
"><iframe src="https://mail.google.com/mail/?logout&hl=es"<>/iframe>
it closes the sesion on gmmail , this is a XSRF , and , in the case
what you say aa
it is executed in context and the location.href value is "about:blank"

So we have dispute it in
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=45401
The developer has release a patch version in trunk =>
http://github.com/AndersSahlin/MailCheckerPlus/blob/54ab118e505feae819e676c8e525e8fe5409c981/src/mailaccount.class.js
please donload it and copy to your extension folder to solve it.
