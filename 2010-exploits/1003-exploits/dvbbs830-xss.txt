Dvbbs is prone to an cross-site scripting vulnerability because the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue to execute arbitrary script code in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch other attacks. 
 
 
Nearly all the Dvbbs version is vulnerable,but Dvbbs 8.3.0.
 
 
 
Vulnerable: Dvbbs < 8.3.0
 
 
i found the xss on "page" parameter in Dvbbs is different。
 
 
Between Dvbbs 7.1.X and 8.2.X , the xss in the "dispbbs.asp", like "dispbbs.asp?boardid=1&id=1&page="
 
In Dvbbs < 7.1.0, the xss in the "list.asp", like "list.asp?boardid=1&id=1&page="
 
 
 
 
 
For example:
 
Between Dvbbs 7.1.X and 8.2.X
http://www.example.com:80/dispbbs.asp?boardid=1&id=1&page="><script>alert(/liscker/);</script>
 
In Dvbbs<7.1.0
http://www.example.com:80/forum1/list.asp?boardid=1&id=1&page=><script>alert(/liscker/);</script>
