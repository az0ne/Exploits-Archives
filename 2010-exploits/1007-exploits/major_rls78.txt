http://www.majorsecurity.net/phpkit-wcms-xss.php

Affected Products:

PHPKIT WCMS 1.6.5
Prior versions may also be vulnerable

"PHPKIT WCMS is an Content Management System."

More Details
=============
We at MajorSecurity have discovered some vulnerabilities in PHPKIT WCMS
1.6.5, which can be exploited by malicious people to conduct reflected
cross-site scripting attacks. Input passed directly to the "searchtext"
parameter in "/de/pk/include.php?path=contentarchive" is not properly
sanitised before being stored and returned to the user. This can be
exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
session in context of an affected site.

Solution
=============
Web applications should never trust on user generated input and
therefore sanatize all input. Edit the source code to ensure that input
is properly sanitised.
