Zend Studio is a commercial, proprietary integrated development environment
(IDE) for PHP developed by Zend Technologies, based on the PHP Development
Tools (PDT) plugin for the Eclipse platform (the PDT project is led by
Zend).
We found a security bug of it in Zend studio [version >6.0], the description
of a function of php script does'nt be escaped or htmlencode, so it lead to
can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code what the attacker
inject evil codz on function’s description.

And this vul is a “Cross-Zone Scripting” vul, so Successful exploitation
allows execution of arbitrary code in user’s system.

DEMO:

ActiveXObject("WScript.shell").Run('calc.exe',1,true);</script>");
*/
function a() {
}

Then Open the function a()’s description [type a word "a" or move your mouse
