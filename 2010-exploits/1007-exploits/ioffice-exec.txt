iOffice 0.1 is vulnerable because it does not sanitize user input.  It seems
to be modular because none of the scripts are exactly the same on ones I've
run across, but they all seem to be vulnerable.  Command execution is
possible.

I couldn't find exactly where this was distributed from, or who the author
is, and it's not written in my native language, so if anyone knows, please
let me know.
