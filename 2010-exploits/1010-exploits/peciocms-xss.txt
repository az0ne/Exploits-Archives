Class: Cross-Site Scripting                     Severity: Medium


Overview:
---------
Pecio Content Management System (CMS) is prone to cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Technical Description:
----------------------
Pecio Content Management System (CMS) is prone to a cross-site scripting
vulnerability as it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

Input passed via the 'target' parameter in 'search' action in index.php is
not properly verified before it is returned to the user. This can be exploited
to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session in the
context of a vulnerable site. This may allow an attacker to steal cookie-based
authentications and launch further attacks.

The vulnerability has been tested in Pecio CMS v2.0.5 and 2.0.2 Other versions
may also be affected.


Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary HTML
code in a user's browser session in the context of a vulnerable application.


Affected Software:
------------------
Pecio CMS v2.0.5 and prior.

Tested on,
Pecio CMS v2.0.5 and 2.0.2(tested using Mozilla firefox browser)
