Sir,

I found out a vulnerability on Google Search, XSS in particular. I
don't know if it has been found before.

SNIPPET - http://www.google.com/search?btnI&q=allinurl:http://www.site
to redirected.com

eg:http://www.google.com/search?btnI&q=allinurl:http://www.yahoo.com
(will redirect to yahoo)

This Moderate vulnerability can be used as a phishing attack!

Yours confidential,
HAXONIC
