Introduction:
=============
FBC-Market is a application that allows you to run your own online marketplace or classifieds listing site 
similar to Craigslist. It was written in PHP and uses MySQL to for data storage. Additionally, it uses 
jQuery for elegant effects and that web 2.0 pizzazz you ve always dreamed of.

The general design is simple and clean which should go well with any site, customization can be done easily 
through the CSS file. You can add your header and footer to it or include it in an iframe and you are ready 
to roll. And if you want to get your hands dirty in code, the comments will help you know what is going on.
