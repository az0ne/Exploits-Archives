Solution:
=========
To fix the security issue the manufacturer have to allow only numbers in the vulnerable parameter. It is always a good idea to 
check all inputs with a whitelist of expect inputs. There are also techniques to block requests to other domains.


Risk:
=====
The security risk of the reflective xss vulnerability is estimated as low(+).
