# -= Info =-
Pastebay is a site for free, uncensored text hosting. 


#-= The Advisory =-

Pastebay suffers from a password bypass vulnerability that allows an attacker to view any paste that is password protected, without entering a password


# -= Example =-

If you download the paste directly [raw] with http://pastebay.com/pastebay.php?dl=[PasteID]  , you bypass the need for a password.

pastebay.php?dl=
