Hello list!

I want to warn you about Information Leakage and Cross-Site Scripting
vulnerabilities in multiple themes for WordPress.

-------------------------
Affected products:
-------------------------

Vulnerable are the next themes by WooThemes: Live Wire (all three themes
from Live Wire series), Gotham News, Typebased, Blogtheme, VibrantCMS, Fresh
News, The Gazette Edition, NewsPress, The Station, The Original Premium
News, Flash News, Busy Bee, Geometric. Other vulnerable themes for WP are
possible.

----------
Details:
----------

In different themes there is test.php - script with phpinfo() - which leads
to Information Leakage (disclosure of FPD and other important information
about the server) and XSS (in PHP < 4.4.1, 4.4.3-4.4.6).

Information Leakage (WASC-13):

http://site/wp-content/themes/_theme's_name_/includes/test.php

XSS (WASC-08):

http://site/wp-content/themes/_theme's_name_/includes/test.php?a[]=%3Cscript%3Ealert(document.cookie)%3C/script%3E

For Live Wire the script is placed at address
http://site/wp-content/themes/livewire/includes/test.php, similarly for
other themes.

------------
Timeline:
------------

2011.04.11 - announced at my site.
2011.04.12 - informed developers.
2011.06.04 - disclosed at my site.

These vulnerabilities are still not fixed by developers. So users of these 
themes are need to fix the vulnerabilities manually (e.g. by deleting of 
this script).

I mentioned about these vulnerabilities at my site
(http://websecurity.com.ua/5071/).
