OK, a nonce has been recently added. Then, the new URL redirection flaw is
in 2 steps :
First, click on
http://victim.be/?wptouch_view=mobile&wptouch_redirect=.attaquer.com, it
will reload the page with seemingly no effect.
Then, click on the switch mobile theme button [ON/OFF] in every page footer,
it will redirect to http://victim.be.attacker-site.com :)

Love.
