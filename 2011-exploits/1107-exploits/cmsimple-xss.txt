* Persistent XSS vulnerability
After login to the demo with password=test, choose edit mode, and then, choose html button in the toolbox, and write the below code, after clearing off the existing code there. A pop up comes showing persistent xss vulnerability in the full version.

Exploit: <IFRAME SRC="javascript:alert('XSS');"></IFRAME>

PS: In the demo, as they have mentioned in the site, the write option to files have been disabled, unlike fullversion. So, here we can only see the way the script behaves in the layout which shows xss vulnerability, which shall be persistent in the full version once the write permissions are allowed.
