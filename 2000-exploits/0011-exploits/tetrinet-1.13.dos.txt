Hi,

I found a bug in Tetrinet v1.13 PUBLIC RELEASE.
If you connect with telnet on the Tetrinet port, and press 'enter' once, 
keeping the connection idle, will halt all other processes. No one else will 
be able to connect, send msgs, etc. The players normally see the status of 
the other players, but won't be able to see 'm continue now. Result: most 
players think they're disconnected, or very lagged. They disconnect :).
But, if you disconnect, everything what happened when it was not able to be 
processed, will be emmediatly processed, so if the server was in a game, it 
would probably be ruined.
