<FONT COLOR="#CC0000">PROBLEM</FONT>

    Microsoft  Office  includes  a  conversion  utility  that converts
    older  Word  documents  to  more  recent  formats.  The conversion
    utility for Word  5 documents in  East Asian languages  (Japanese,
    Korean,  Simplified  Chinese  and  Traditional  Chinese)  has   an
    unchecked  buffer.   By  using  a  hexadecimal  editor  to  insert
    specially-malformed information into a document, a malicious  user
    could  cause  Word  to  run  code  of  his  or her choice when the
    document was opened using an affected version of the converter.

    A  Word  5  converter  installs  by  default  as  part of Word and
    PowerPoint,  and  can  be  installed  at  user behest as part of a
    converter pack.  However, the vulnerability affects only the  East
    Asian language  versions of  the converter,  and only  the Windows
    versions of them. No other language versions of the converter  are
    affected,  and  no  version  of  the  converter  for  Macintosh is
    affected.
