(_<

Date: 2000, 03/01
Affected Software: iMail Server 5.0
Platform: Windows NT 4.0 SP 6a

*Problem*
A malicous user can read and send emails as any other user on
the system.

*How*
The issue lies in how iMail handles the creating of new email
accounts, and how it stores them.

When iMail is default installed all new email accounts are
stored in the same directory. So, the directory that held the
email
account for admin@domain.com would be stored in the same
directory as user@otherdomain.com.

*Exploit*
Now if user@otherdoamin.com has mail administration turned on,
user could create a new account under his domain
(otherdomain.com)
for admin, and since it iMail would store it in the same
directory as the as the admin@doamin.com account, they would
then become
one in the same. Thus allowing user@otherdomain.com to read ALL
incoming emails to admin@domain.com and all other 'admin' users
on
the system by sharing the same 'admin' folder. As you can
imagine, this could pose a serious risk to security.

*Fix*
When creating a new email account for a domain in iMail
Administrator, choose a custom path to save all accounts to.
Example:
D:\IMAIL\newdomain.com

As long as an administrator is keeping his eye on the ball this
little problem can be avoided.

*Notes*
I have not tested this problem on any earlier version of
iMail... Other versions are probably affected too. If you find
out they
are please email me.

*Shouts*

Ross, Everyone @ yak.net, and the girl who crushed Lupus's heat
today, this
means you Anna.
