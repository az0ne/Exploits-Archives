  OVERVIEW
  ---------

  RapidStream has hard-coded the 'rsadmin' account into the sshd
  binary in the appliance OS. The account has been given a 'null' password 
  in which password assignment and authentication was expected to be
  handled by the RapidStream software itself. The vendor failed to realize that
  arbitrary commands could be appended to the ssh string when connecting to
  the SSH server on the remote vpn. This in effect could lead to many things, 
  including the ability to spawn a remote root shell on the vpn.
 
  e.g. [root@attacker]# ssh -l rsadmin <ip of vpn> "/bin/sh -i;"
  e.g. [root@attacker]# ssh -l rsadmin <ip of vpn> "vi /etc/shadow"
 
 
  SYSTEMS AFFECTED
  I have not yet tested this with other VPN appliances that have
  installed SSH as their choice for remote access.
 
  1. RapidStream 8000 Family
  2. RapidStream 6000 Family
  3. RapidStream 4000 Family
  4. RapidStream 2000 Family
 
 
  IMPACT
  ------

  1. Attacker can use VPN to ftp, and even install and run packet
  sniffers on the VPN which will allow him to sniff all traffic coming in and out
  of the VPN. Due to the fact that the administrator is not aware of the
  ability to spawn root shells, the intruder can go completely undetected.
 
  2. Immediate remote root access to VPN
 
  3. Can download /etc/shadow file to crack accounts including
  root. This will give the attacker the default password for all root accounts for all
  deployed RapidStream products.
 
  SOLUTION
  ---------

  RapidStream has been contacted and is working on a new revision
  in which SSHD comes uninstalled. For those that do not wish to wait can put the
  VPN appliance behind a firewall where port 22 has been closed. An alternative
  is to use the vulnerability to ssh into the vpn and turn off SSHD yourself.
