OS/2 Warp 4.5 FTP Server DoS

Advisory Code:   VIGILANTE-2000006

Release Date:
August 15, 2000

Systems Affected:
-      OS/2 Warp 4.5 FTP server V4.0/4.2
- OS/2 Warp 4.5 FTP server V4.3
- Probably  other versions of the software as well.

THE PROBLEM
The FTP server that comes with OS/2 Warp 4.5 TCP/IP can be brought down by a
malicious connection attempt.

Vendor Status:
The vendor has released the patch for the problem and it contains
the following explanation of the problem: "Sending username/password
followed immediately by up to 1k of data when connecting to FTP via Telnet,
can cause a trap. ".
During testing we found that an initial connection attempt (using sockets,
telnet, ftp) using an invalid username/password combination, followed by a
second attempt, where the userfield was exceptionally long (256 bytes) would
crash the service.

Fix:
In case you are using a version prior to 4.3, please contact IBM support for
further assistance.
If you are using v4.3, you can get the patch at the following URL:
