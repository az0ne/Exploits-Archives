Intel Express Switch 500 series DoS

Advisory Code:   VIGILANTE-2000007

Release Date:
August 28, 2000

Systems Affected:
Intel Express Switch 550F
- Firmware version 2.63
- Firmware version 2.64
Based on the response from Intel (quoted below), it is very likely that
other switches from the same series are also affected.

THE PROBLEM
By sending an IP packet, either to the Intel Express 550F or a host behind
it, with a malformed IP-header, the box crashes. To restart it, you need
to pull the plug (the reset button also looses functionality).

Vendor Status:
Intel was contacted on the 18th of July, and on the 21st of July a beta fix
was produced. Regression testing on the fix is not yet complete.

Fix (quote from the vendor):
"We're still working on a solution for you. Until then, I would advise that
any reporting, from you/your company, of this issue with the 500 series
switches MUST include a statement which indicates contacting Intel® Customer
Support for a fix. Following this, Intel® Customer Support will send the
patch to the customer(s).
