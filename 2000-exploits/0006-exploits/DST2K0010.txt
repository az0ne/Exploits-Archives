I. Description
================================================================================

Vendor URL: http://www.lilikoi.com/

Severity: low

The html code which is generated by ceilidh.exe (example URL below) contains a
hidden form field by the name of "translated_path".

This path is the REAL location of the Ceilidh files (typically under Web root)

Example URL: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/ceilidh.exe/ceilidh/?N4


Severity: med

By using a specially crafted POST statement it is possible to spawn multiple
copies of ceilidh.exe each taking 1% of CPU and 700k of memory. This can be
sent multiple times to cause resource depletion on the remote host. To free all
the resources you must shutdown and restart the World Wide Web Publishing Service.


II. Solution
================================================================================

Vendor Status: Informed

Currently there is no known solution to the problem.
