              REMOTE ROOT VULNERABILITY IN GSSFTP DAEMON

2000-06-14

SUMMARY:

A remote user may execute certain FTP commands without authorization.

IMPACT:

A remote user may perform denial of service attacks.

An attacker with access to a local account may gain unauthorized root
access.

VULNERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS:

Source distributions which may contain vulnerable code include:

        MIT Kerberos 5 releases krb5-1.1 and krb5-1.1.1

The beta releases krb5-1.1.2-beta1 and krb5-1.2-beta2 are also
vulnerable.

NON-VULNERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS:

        MIT Kerberos 5 releases krb5-1.0.x

FIXES:

If you are running a vulnerable FTP daemon, disable it immediately,
usually by commenting it out of your inetd.conf and sending a SIGHUP
to the inetd process.

To correct the bug, apply the following patch, rebuild, and reinstall
ftpd on the affected machines.

The upcoming krb5-1.2 release will correct this problem.  There will
be a krb5-1.2-beta3 release later this week that will correct this
problem.

PATCHES:

These patches will apply against krb5-1.1.1, krb5-1.1.2-beta1, and
krb5-1.2-beta2.  They will be made available on the web site at:

        http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/ftpd_111_patch.txt

The MIT Kerberos security advisories page is at:

        http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/www/advisories/index.html

Patches for other security problems as well as archives of security
advisory postings are located on that page.
