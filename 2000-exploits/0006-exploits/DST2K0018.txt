I. Description

Vendor URL: http://www.webbbs.org/

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerabilities in WebBBS under Windows NT.

Severity: high

By using the Webserver which is shipped and installed by default with WebBBS
it
is possible to cause a BufferOverRun in WebBBS. This is done be connecting
to port 80 (WebBBS) which the service resides on by  default and sending a
large
filename. The string has to be a length of 227 + EIP (4 bytes making a total
of
231 bytes). This will cause the above application to BufferOverRun over
writing
EIP. This would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

it

to port 80 (WebBBS) which the service resides on by  default and sending a
large
get statements (the Logon screen is a good example). The string has to be a
length of 545 + EIP (4 bytes making a total of 549 bytes). This will cause
the
above application to BufferOverRun over writing EIP. This would allow an
attacker
to execute arbitrary code.
