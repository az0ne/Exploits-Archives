Vendor URL: http://www.openview.hp.com/

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in HP Openview Node Manager under Windows NT.

Severity: high

By using the Alarm service which is shipped and installed by default with HP
openview network node manager it is possible to cause a Buffer overrun in 
OVALARMSRV overwriting the EIP allowing the execution of arbitry code. This 
is done be connecting to post 2345 which the port resides on by default and 
sending a large string. The string has to be a length of 4064 + EIP (4 bytes) 
making a total of 4068 bytes.


II. Solution

Vendor Status: Informed

Currently there is no vendor patch available but the following are preventative
measures Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team would advise users running
this service to implement.

o Access list port 2345 on the next hop router for only allowed hosts.
