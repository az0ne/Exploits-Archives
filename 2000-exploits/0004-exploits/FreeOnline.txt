FreeOnline currently makes it's free users surf non-free zones for 30 
minutes
and 2hour lots within certain hours of the day. If you are a FreeOnline user
which I currently am you may be interested to know that there is a way out
to non-free sites using a site which FreeOnline does achknowledge as a site
to be surfed at any times. If you have ever used Hotmail.com before then you
may have noticed how when you click a link in your inbox it opens a new
browser and adds a little frame that says "You are now visiting a site out 
of
hotmail". So FreeOnline knows that you are in hotmail.com yes but what Free-
Online does not know is that you have gone through hotmail and hotmail has
now viewed another site for you. The reason I explain this hole is due to I
needed to get to a site I was working on urgently and it was not a site
FreeOnline allowed me to surf at all times, so I needed to figure out a way
I could access the non-free site's whenever I needed to.

Things you should have
-----------------------
An email account with http://www.hotmail.com
An internet access acccount with http://www.FreeOnline.com.au

How to access non-free site's after using up your "allocated free time"
------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Know the address of the non-free site you want to access.
2. Log into http://www.hotmail.com with your account.
3. If your hotmail email account is el337d00d@hotmail.com
then email the address of the non-free site to el337d00d@hotmail.com.
4. Check your inbox you should now have an email from yourself.
5. Go into that email.
6. You should see something like http://www.angelfire.com or whatever
the non-free site you put into the email you sent yoourself.
7. Click that link and you'll access the non-free site through hotmail.

I hope someone out there finds this usefull.
