http://www.cerberus-infosec.co.uk/advisories.shtml

Released               : 5th May 2000
Name                   : DNewsweb Buffer Overflow
Affected Systems : *nix/Win32 Web Servers running Dnewsweb
Issue                   : Attackers can remotely execute arbitrary code
Author                  : Mark Litchfield (xor-syst@devilnet.co.uk)

Description
***********
The Cerberus Security Team has found a remotely exploitable buffer overrun
in Netwin's (http://netwinsite.com) DNewsWeb (dnewsweb/dnewsweb.exe v5.3e1),
CGI program designed to give access to NNTP services over the world wide
web. By supplying a specially formed QUERY_STRING to the program a buffer is
overflowed allowing execution of arbitrary code compromising the web server.


Details
*******
The are several unchecked buffers in this program where several of the
QUERY_STRING parameters can be overflowed such as "group" and "utag". This
overflow is simple to exploit by overwriting the saved return address with
an address that contains a "jmp esp" or "call esp" - the remainder of the
the QUERY_STRING is pointed to by the ESP.

Solution
********
Netwin has made available a patch for this available from their ftp server:
ftp://ftp.netwinsite.com/pub/dnewsweb/beta/
Obtain the 5.4c3 version required for your system.

A check for this has been added to our security scanner, CIS. More details
