Hello Thomas,

I got your proxy/perver Software and I really liked it, but I found a serious security bug in your HTTP-server software (enabled by default).I think you know that kind of bugs, because it seems that you tried to prevent that kind of misuse, but I found a way how it still works. Here is how to exploit the bug for cracking systems running Jana. I tested it with Jana 1.45 on Windows 98 and Windows 2000.

1. Open a browser window
2. Type i.e http://the.server.com/./.././.././.././windows/win.ini

You will notice that the server offers you to download win.ini (if Jana is installed in the default path, otherwise a modification is requiered) . I think you can imagine how to modify the URL, to download any file you want.

Don't be down now, I already found and reported a lot of bugs of that kind in other software packages. It seems many programmers (also provessional ones) don't really check for such esay to find bugs.

P.S.: I hope you will realese a bug fix soon! ;)
P.SS.: Jana is very cool, good work!
