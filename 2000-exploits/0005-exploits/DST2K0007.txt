I. Description
================================================================================


Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in the ITHouse Mail Server under Windows NT.

Sending an email via SMTP to an IT House Mail Server with a recipient's name in
excess of 2270 bytes causes the IT House Mail Server to buffer overrun overwriting
the EIP (2270 + EIP). This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the 
the server.

Example:
HELO example.org
MAIL FROM:example@example.org
RCPT TO:<A x 2270> + EIP
DATA

.
QUIT

Wait for the mail delivery routine to start at which point the server will crash
executing the arbitrary code.


II. Solution
================================================================================

Vendor Status: Informed

Currently there is no known solution to this problem.
