messages

The usual standard disclaimer applies, especially the fact that Georgi
Guninski is not liable for any damages caused by direct or  indirect use
of the information or functionality provided by this program.

Description:
Outlook Express 5.01 and Internet Explorer 5.01 under Windows 95
(suppose other versions are also vulnerable)
allow reading subsequently opened email messages after a hostile message
is opened.

Details:
The problem is assigning the document object of the email message to a
variable in a newly opened window.
Thru this variable access is possible to open email messages.


The code that must be included in HTML message is :
---------------------------------------------------------------------
<SCRIPT>
a=window.open("about:<A HREF='javascript:alert(x.body.innerText)' >Click
here to see the active message</A>");
a.x=window.document;
</SCRIPT>
---------------------------------------------------------------------


Workaround: Disable Active Scripting
