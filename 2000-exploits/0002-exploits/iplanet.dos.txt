Hello,

I could find out the denial of service effected to iPlanet
Web Server, Enterprise Edition 4.1 on Linux 2.2.5(Redhat6.1J;
Kernel 2.2.12).

When I tried to send the request "GET" of seven hundred times
your product consumed all memory resouce and karnel paniced.
The size of GET command to your product was about a couple of
thousands.

But I could not find out any problem when I gave same situation
to the Enterprise Server International Edition 3.6SP2 on
Solaris 2.6J (Sparc), the Enterprise Server 3.6SP3 on Solaris
2.6J (Sparc) , the iPlanet Web Server, Enterprise Edition 4.0SP3
on Solaris 2.6J (Sparc) and the Apache httpd on Redhat6.1J.

For example, Apache is able to refuse the attack of DoS, when
the maximam number of fork() is defined propery.
Does this product do nothing?

I have posted this problem to Netscape by input-form on the web.
BUT I have no response from them for three weeks.
So I have sent to the staff of Netscape who use his influence
for me by Feb 18th. BUT he reply me NOTHING yet. They ignore me?

My original message to Netscape is follows.
(I typed and chose on the Web of Netscape.)
