=====================================

Vulnerability Summary
---------------------

Problem: Bypassing authentication on Axis 700 Network Scanner;
               By modifying an URL, outsiders can access
               administrator URLs without entering username
               and password.

Threat: Unauthorized access.

Platform: Axis 700 Network Scanner Server
               (Software Version 1.12)

Solution: Non? Se below.


Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
User pages are located under http://server/user/.
The URL to the configuration page is:
http://server/admin/this_axis700/this_axis700.shtml
This page is password protected. The actual configuration takes place on the
pages linked from this page. By changing the URL to:
http://server/user/../admin/this_axis700/this_axis700.shtml
gives an outsider access to the configuration page without entering username and
password. The server seems to check access permissions before URL conversion.
The server also decodes %1u to %2e (not a vulnerability).
