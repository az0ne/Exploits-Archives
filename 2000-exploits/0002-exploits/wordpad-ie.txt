Description:
There is a vulnerability in Wordpad which allows executing arbitrary
programs without warning the user after activating an embedded or linked
object. This may be also exploited in IE for Win9x.

Details:
Wordpad executes programs embeded in .doc or .rtf documents without any
warning if the object is activated by doubleclick.
This may be exploited in IE for Win9x using the view-source: protocol.
The view-source: protocol starts Notepad, but if the file is large, then
the user is asked to use Wordpad. So creating a large .rtf document and
creating a HTML view-source: link to it in a HTML page or HTML based
email message will prompt the user to use Wordpad and a program may be
executed if the user doubleclicks on an object in the opened document.

Demonstration which starts AUTOEXEC.BAT:

Workaround: Do not activate objects in Wordpad documents
