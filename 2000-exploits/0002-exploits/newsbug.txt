     I created my NewsBug approximately 2-3 months ago but never did =
anything further with it as I have a lot of other projects I am working =
on. I reported this to MS on Feb 17 while attending the W2K launch; but =
haven't heard anything from them since.   Basically what it is : a web =
page or an email that when viewed in Outlook (all versions 4.0 and up) =
and Netscape all versions 4.0 and up that have been set up and are the =
default email and news reader.  with JavaScript and html view enabled.  =
When the web page is viewed it opens up OE or NS and starts making bogus =
news group file entries, it doesn't subscribe to them cause they don't =
exist; but it forces the user to manually delete them. to view a POC go =
to: http://www.zoomnet.net/~quick/error/newsbug.html

During testing in approximately 50% of the time OE would crash before it =
can be stopped, and when OE is opened back up instead of it coming up =
and saying OE wasn't shut down properly and the page is not being showed =
because of possible security concerns, doesn't come up; but instead when =
OE is rebooted it comes back up and starts making them all over again, =
well that is if they have it set with the preview pane option enabled =
and the order of the messages is to show the newest one at the bottom.

For it to work in email it requires an additional file and if you wish =
to see a poc of it used in email then send me an email authorizing me to =
send it to you; because I am not in the habit of sending unsolicited =
malicious code through email.

Fix:  NO known fix
Work around:  Disable JavaScript

   This next one, I am not sure if it is already known or not, it is =
sort of like Georgi Guninskis' word pad code execution but it uses a =
.shs (scrap file).  It is possible to create a .shs file that contains =
executable code then when run outside of word, will execute the code =
without opening word.  I only mention it because a lot of casual users =
are not familure with the file extension and might run it because the =
icon looks like a text file.  this link =
http://www.zoomnet.net/~quick/test/test.shs
is to a file that when run will format the A:\ drive it was created by =
making an .exe in VB5 pro that does the format, compiling the file into =
an .exe file then right clicking the .exe file and choosing copy and =
then opening Word 2K, and right clicking in the document body and =
selecting paste, then saving the word document and then closing word, =
opening word back up and right clicking on the .exe file and selecting =
copy , then closing word, right clicking on the desktop and choosing =
paste, the resulting file is a  text scrap  test.shs, and if test.shs is =
opened up formats the A:\ drive without opening up word.  If they are =
set for double click then double clicking  test.shs will format the A:\ =
drive and the same if they are set for single click.

     This is the first time I have contacted you.  I received a link to =
your page from a friend and they said I should email you and tell you =
about these and other stuff I have created.   I am NOT a hacker or =
anything like that , I am however an avid computer enthusiast.  I am =
disabled and almost house bound, and in a lot of physical pain.  In =
order to take my mind off the pain (which the morphine the doctors give =
me don't do much for the pain) I have found that if I totally absorb my =
mind with the computer I can for short periods of time be almost pain =
free.  I have been around computers most of my adult life, and while in =
the military was trained as a 26T20 (television equipment repairman) and =
spent most of my tour in the Army repairing main frame computers.  I =
have NO degree in programming or any computer related discipline, but I =
am self taught. =20

Well this is quite a lengthy email and I am sorry for the size of it.  I =
hope to hear from you  one way or the other about these.
