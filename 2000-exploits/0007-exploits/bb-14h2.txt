versions affected: bb14h2 (current) and older


exploit:
	bbd listens for incoming connections on port 1984.
Using telnet or the bb client, it is possible to
connect and create a filename with an arbitrary
extension, as the extension is not rigorously checked.
 As this file is droped into a directory accessible
via the web server, any file extension that is parsed
server side can be abused.  For example:

./bb 1.2.3.4 "status evil.php3 <?<system(\"cat
/etc/passwd\");?>"

will allow viewing of the /etc/passwd upon browsing to
http://1.2.3.4/bb/logs/evil.php3.
	

solutions:
	-Modify bbd.c to only allowed specified file
extensions(.disk, .proc ...)

	-Implement access restrictions via
$BBHOME/etc/security to minimize exposure to
vulnerabilities.  Unfortunately, the default install
doesn't enable the security file.
