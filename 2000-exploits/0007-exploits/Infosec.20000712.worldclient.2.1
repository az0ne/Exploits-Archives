in this

Vulnerability Description
-------------------------
The web server WDaemon/2.1, which is a part of the web-based Email solution
World
     Client 2.1 is vulnerable for root dot dot in some cases. When requesting
the URL http://email.victim.com/..\..\..\winnt\repair\sam._ from Linux 
2.X and
Netscape 4.08
the sam._ is downloaded.
It seems like this vulnerability is not present when requesting the same URL
from
Windows NT 4.0 with Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Communicator 6.0. When
using
these newer browsers the backslash is automatically exchanged for a for=
ward
slash
and I get a message that I am requesting a forbidden page.
