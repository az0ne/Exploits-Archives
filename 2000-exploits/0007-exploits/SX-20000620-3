SecureXpert Labs Advisory [SX-20000620-3] - Partial Denial of
Service in Check Point Firewall-1 on Windows NT

Summary

The SMTP Security Server component of Check Point Firewall-1 4.0 and 4.1 is
vulnerable to a simple network-based attack which raises the firewall load to
100%.

Details

Check Point Firewall-1 includes a component called the SMTP Security Server.
This is an SMTP proxy, the use of which is required by several of Firewall-1's
advanced SMTP email processing capabilities, including CVP-based virus
scanning and URI filtering.

The Check Point Firewall-1 SMTP Security Server in Firewall-1 4.0 and 4.1
on Windows NT is vulnerable to a simple network-based attack which can increase
the firewall's CPU utilization to 100%.

Sending a stream of binary zeros over the network to the SMTP port on the firewall
raises the target system's load to 100% while the load on the attacker's
system machine remains relatively low.  This can easily be reproduced from
a Linux system using netcat with an input of /dev/zero, with a command such as
"nc firewall 25 < /dev/zero".

This vulnerability could allow a very quick and easy distributed attack
on Check Point Firewall-1.

Status

Check Point Software Technologies has been informed of this vulnerability, and
has assigned it incident ID# TT44913.  As of June 20, 2000 Check Point
has stated that a fix for this vulnerability will NOT be included in Service
Pack 2 (SP-2) for Check Point firewall-1 4.1, but it will "probably be included
in SP-3".
