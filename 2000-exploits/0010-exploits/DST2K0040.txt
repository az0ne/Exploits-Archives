I. Description
============================================================================

Vendor URL: http://www.wquinn.com/

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in WQuinn QuotaAdvisor under WindowsNT.

Severity: Low

It is possible to list all of the files contained on a file system which
is on a server with QuotaAdvisor running upon it. This requires only a
normal user account (i.e. non adminstrator/poweruser). This normal user
account can list the top level administration shares but not the contents.
However if you run a report upon that share the report will contain a
complete list of files and their physical locations.
