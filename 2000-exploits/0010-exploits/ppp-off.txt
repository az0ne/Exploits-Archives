Hi,

In SlackWare Linux the script /usr/bin/ppp-off writes the output of 'ps x' 
to /tmp/grep.tmp
Since root is the user that runs ppp-off, a non-privileged user could create 
a link from /tmp/grep.tmp to any file (ie: /etc/issue), thus when root runs 
the ppp-off script, the output of 'ps x' would be put in the linked file. 
The fix would be to replace every instance of /tmp/grep.tmp in the ppp-off 
script to something along the line of /root/grep.tmp

Take care,
sinfony
