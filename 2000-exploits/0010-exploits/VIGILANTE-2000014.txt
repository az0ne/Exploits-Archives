THE PROBLEMS
The firmware in the HP JetDirect card contain multiple vulnerabilities
that can have effects ranging from the service crashing to the printer
initiating a firmware upgrade based on random garbage in the memory,
and in the last case powercycling won't fix the crash. It requires a
new firmware burn by eg. HP to restore the Jetdirect card.

The FTP service, the TELNET service and the LPD service all contain
buffer handling problems. Furthermore, the JetDirect IP implementation
contains a vulnerability that will cause the printer to crash, if a
certain malformed packet is sent to the printer. This packet can be
spoofed.
