All versions of Win 95 & 98 in a LAN can be crashed using a modified version of the 'win98-con'-Bug. The target must have at lea
st one shared directory (read-only access is enough).

You just have to execute a 'special' link in a HTML-File on your own machine. This will crash down the victim's machine in the L
AN and maybe even in the Internet (I've not yet tested this possibility).


<html>
<head><title>Crash!</title></head>
<body>
<a href="file://victim/directory/con/con">click me!</a>
</body>
</html>

In this code fragment 'victim' is the name of victim's machine and 'directory' is any shared directory on this machine. Clicking
 on this link will crash the machine as described in the 'win98-con.txt' by Zoa Chien in March, 3rd.
