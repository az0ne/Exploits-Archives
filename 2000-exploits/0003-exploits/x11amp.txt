Overview: 	To start out with I am pretty sure that I am not the one
that has found this little tmp file problem because, well, it's too damn
obvious!  Anyways the program x11amp when executed creates a tmp file called
/tmp/X11Amp_CTRL which can be symlinked to your file of choice that you
would like to have zero'd out, then wait for mister root to play his celine
dion mp3's and bang.  Simple enough?  I thought so.
