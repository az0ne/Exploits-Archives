As all Ascii-Symbols can be displayed in &#XXX; format, where XXX are
numbers from 0-255, AIM seems not to check the XXX for higher values
and some strings above 255 result in aim crashing completly or in part.

E.g. the string &#770; will result in crashing the whole aim, but &#771;
will crash only the instant message window (&#771; was only tested once
by me).
It will crash the AIM of the attacker too, because AIM displays the string
in the attacker-Instant Message, so the attacker-AIM also tries to convert
it and errors.

There is already an unofficial fix available, which can be downloaded at my
hompage: http://laugh.at/cruz
The fix is an edited ate32.dll, which should be copied to the aim directory.
With it, aim doesnt try to convert "&#XXX;"-type of strings anymore, a
minimum drawback (note: with that fix, the attacker can use this exploit to
crash other unfixed AIMs, but wont crash his/her own AIM).

Affected versions: I tested this only on 3.5+ versions of AIM, but all other
versions are most likely affected too.
