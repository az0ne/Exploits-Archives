Discussion
----------

phpPhotoAlbum is the next generation of dynamic photo albums, distributed under GPL.
This product is made by the 'Professional Web Application Development Group' and 
can be downloaded from http://www.phpphotoalbum.com/

Specialised features of this PHP script include:

        .Custom Photo Folder Messages 
        .Multi-level Photo Albums 
        .Graphic User Interface 
        .Supported Most Image Types  


Vulnerability
-------------

Any user is able to traverse a directory as a request to the script using the $folder
variable. It is then possible to read any file/folder with priviledges as the httpd.

For instance:
http://www.phpphotoalbum.com/products/phpPhotoAlbum/explorer.php?folder=../../../../../../../etc/

.. will reveal all the files located in the specified directory.


Solution
--------

The vendors have been informed of the bug.

Wait for the next patched version of PhotAlbum to be released.
