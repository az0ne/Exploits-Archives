Intel Express Switch series 500 DoS #2

Advisory Code:   VIGILANTE-2000010

Release Date:
September 6, 2000

Systems Affected:
Intel Express Switch 510T
- Firmware version 2.63
- Firmware version 2.64
Intel Express Switch 520T
- Firmware version 2.63
- Firmware version 2.64
Intel Express Switch 550T

It is likely that older firmware versions are also affected.

THE PROBLEM
By sending a malformed ICMP packet, either to the Intel Express
Switch or a host behind it, the CPU crashes. The switch looses
all routing functionality but continues to function as a switch,
except for the fact that learning also crashes, so new connections
are not "picked up". The packet can be sent from a machine
directly connected to the switch or from a machine not directly
connected to the switch. Since the packet does not require a reply,
the packet can also be spoofed.

A Side Note:
During testing we also found the SNMP command that reboots the
switch, and just as a friendly reminder, please do remember to change
your switch's SNMP community name from the default to something a bit
harder to guess, since the reboot command can also be spoofed.

Vendor Status:
Intel was contacted on the 3rd of September and the vulnerability was
verified by them the following day. The fix was officially released
on the 5th of September.

Fix:
The fix for the Intel Express Switches 510T, 520T, 550T and 550F
