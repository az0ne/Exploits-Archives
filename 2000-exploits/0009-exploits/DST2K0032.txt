I. Description
============================================================================

Vendor URL: http://www.talentsoft.com

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in Webplus under Windows NT.

Severity: low - Path revealing

It is possible to cause Webplus to reveal the physical path which it is
installed within. This is done by executing the CGI application and passing
a single .

example: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?script=.

This will respond with an error message detailing the physical path.

Severity: low - Internal IP address leakage

If your server is being NAT'd (i.e. located behind a firewall/load balancer)
it is possible to retrieve your internal IP address by passing the about
option to the cgi application.

example: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?about

Severity: medium - Source code viewing on NTFS partitions

It is possible to cause Webplus to reveal the source code of the WML files
which are located on NTFS partitions. This is done by appending the data
stream
you wish on to the WML file.

example: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?script=test.wml::$DATA

The danger here as the Delphis team have demonstrated is being able to
access
DSN information (datasource, table names, usernames & passwords). It is also
possible if the Script root has been set to the webroot to read the source
code of other script files (i.e. ASP).

example: http://127.0.0.1/cgi-bin/webplus.exe?script=test.asp::$DATA

II. Solution
============================================================================

Vendor Status: Informed

Delphis are happy to announce that Talentsoft has a patch for the above
::$DATA issue. The following was information recieved from the vendor.

You require build 542 (to fully disable the parsing of ::$DATA requires
using a newly rebuilt webplus.dll in addition to the use of build 542 of
webpsvc.exe web+ server)).

If you have any issues obtaining this patch please contact Talentsoft
support.
