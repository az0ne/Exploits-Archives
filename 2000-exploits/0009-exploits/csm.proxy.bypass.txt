Hi there!

Something which might be worth a note...

we are using csm´s proxy server and it´s siteblocker feature which is an
option to enable url-filtering...BUT...if you surf to an "outside" proxy
(e.g. spaceproxy) you can bypass url filtering by siteblocker due to a imho
"design flaw" in the parsing mechanism, which seems to parse an URL only to
the first delimiter...
Thus the rules for allowed URLs are not in place anymore and you can surf to
any site...

...i gave CSM a call and they adviced me just to add the outside proxy
adresses to the "blocked sites", but due to the fact that the number of
outside proxie´s is a growing number this would no be a good solution imo...
