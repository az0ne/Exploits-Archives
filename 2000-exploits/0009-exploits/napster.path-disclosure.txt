ADVISORY:

here goes......               ( hi lindsay, pat, jason , and t-rex)

After running a test capture using the latest version of ethereal, 
i noticed that when i did a search on napster that the packets received revealed the full path of the stored file

Now i know what your thinking, big deal so napster reveals the full path.
well hey, i agree its not the eeye iis hole but its something , 
and as any hacker knows any little bit of information helps.  
                                               
 ----- heres a sample of some captured data: -----

When looking at the napster returned results we see (\current favorites\rob d -clubbed to death.mp3) as being the folder, 
Now lets say the person behind the cheezy napster username (in this case LuvURMom2)is the admin of a web site with sensitive info
and lets say he or she is a real idiot and makes the default folder to store shared mp3s the root folder of the web server,
well now we would know what that is , so while in napster click the file and download it ,run netstat and get the target's ip address,
and so on and so on ............. use your imagination.
