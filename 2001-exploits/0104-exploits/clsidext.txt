   Description:
   
   By double clicking from Window Explorer or Internet Explorer on filenames with innocent
   extensions the user may be tricked to execute arbitrary programs.
   
   Details:
   If the file extension is certain CLSID e.g.:
   testhta.txt.{3050F4D8-98B5-11CF-BB82-00AA00BDCE0B}
   then Windows explorer and IE do not show the CLSID and only the .txt extension,
   while the above file is in fact .hta file.
   Some exploit scenarios include leaving such malicous files on shared resources or
   sending them in archive by email.
   
   Workaround: Do not doubleclick from Windows Explorer or Internet Explorer
