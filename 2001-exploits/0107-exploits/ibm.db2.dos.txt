IBM DB2 for Windows (98/NT/2000) run 2 services : db2ccs.exe (listening on
port 6790) and db2jds.exe (port 6789). 
I may be wrong but these services are used to access data remotely and to
remotely manage the database.

Both can be crashed remotely: just telnet on their port, send one byte and
then close the connexion, that's all.

IBM is aware of that. They reproduced the problem and say that a patch will
be availlable in july (so this month) for version 7 and above.
