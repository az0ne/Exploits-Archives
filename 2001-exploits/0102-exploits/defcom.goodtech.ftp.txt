              	 GoodTech Systems FTP Connection DoS

Author: Peter Gründl <peter.grundl@defcom.com>
Release Date: 2001-01-22
======================================================================
------------------------=[Brief Description]=-------------------------
The GoodTech FTP server does not properly free ressources. This can
result in the FTP server either crashing or displaying its banner and
immediately disconnecting the user.

------------------------=[Affected Systems]=--------------------------
- GoodTech Systems FTP 3.0.1.2.1.0 (evaluation build)

----------------------=[Detailed Description]=------------------------
Connecting approx. 2060-2080 times (one at a time) to the FTP server,
using sockets, can result in the server either crashing or refusing
to accept more connections. This appears to depend on the rate the
connections are received by the FTP server. A fast flood results in a
crash, whereas a slow flood results in the ftp banner being displayed
and an immediate disconnect.

---------------------------=[Workaround]=-----------------------------
Obtain the latest build from the vendor: http://www.goodtechsys.com

-------------------------=[Vendor Response]=--------------------------
This issue was brought to the vendor's attention on the 11th of
January, 2001. A workaround was received from the vendor on the 12th
of January, 2001.
