X-Poll Version 2.0 allows you to create polls with unlimited options which have their own start and expiry dates. You can choose whether to protect your poll with IP and/or Cookie protection. You can even choose how often users can vote on your poll. New with V2.0 is the ability to choose the bars which represent the polls options when the polls results are viewed. The admin area allows you to Add/Edit/Delete/View polls with ease
