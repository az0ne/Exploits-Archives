Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in serendipity 1.3 installer, CVE-2008-1386
References

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1386
http://www.s9y.org/
Description

The installer of serendipity 1.3 has various Cross Site Scripting issues. This 
is considered low priority, as attack scenarios are very unlikely.

Various path fields are not escaped properly, thus filling them with 
javascript code will lead to XSS. MySQL error messages are not escaped, thus 
the database host field can also be filled with javascript.
Workaround/Fix

If you are doing a fresh installation of serendipity, use version 1.3.1.

In general, don't leave uninstalled webapplications laying around on a public 
webspace.
