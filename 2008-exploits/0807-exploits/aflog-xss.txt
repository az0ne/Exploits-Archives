//Bug
Users' display names are not sanitized, allowing XSS attacks to be performed.

//PoC
When signing up, use the display name:
<script>alert('xss')</script>
This affects your name when viewing any page that you have posted a comment on.
It also affects anyone viewing any page while you are online, as aflog prints a list of online users in the page footer.
