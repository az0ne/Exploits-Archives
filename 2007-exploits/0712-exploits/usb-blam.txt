I discovered rather inadvertently that laptops do not enjoy having their USB
VCC shorted to GND one bit. It is a sure DoS, in fact if the machine has a
stupid power supply, it could result in permanent damage. It is kind of scary
for kiosk machines like the those ubiquitous Kodak photo centers.

I give you, the usb pwner. It could even hide inside a legitimate stick:
