I am Fugitif and on this small tutorial I want to show you how can work one
vulnerable XSS Alert Bug on Google.com.
 To be more precise our link is http://finance.google.com

 Ok..My XSS alert is here
http://finance.google.com/finance/portfolio?action=add&hash

 How you see in the screen we need authentication.

 Good,I go inside with my account and now I try to add something on my
Portofolio. I try to add something like this

 "><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>  OR:  like this "><script>alert(
document.cookie)</script>  :)

 After I have put that string and I press the key  "Add to portofolio"  we
can see the surprise

That's all...We hope this bug can be fixed soon!
