I am still Fugitif and now I want to show you how can work one vulnerable

  I go to select one version and I crush above

  and immediately later click  "I WANT THIS ONE"


 In the square where asks FOR "ID" I put some string  like this
"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

( or nothing we go directly on the "Browse" )

 and click "Browse"

 Now we cannot do anything else other than to use the search with our magic
string

"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

 Result ? !
