Olate download is prone to Cross site scripting, cause of trusting to unsafe variable, $_SERVER[PHP_SELF].
Programmers team, trusted that $_SERVER[PHP_SELF] contained executed php file. I was reading bug report of this issue in php support site. it was reported as a bug but support team accepted this as a documentation bug.
Related code lied at:386 uim.php
