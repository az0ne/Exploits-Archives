[- Description -]

PHP File Sharing System is vulnerable to directory traversal due to 
insufficient security validation and sanitization of user-data. The 
 vulnerability allows the attacker to list directories, delete 
files  and create new directories on the system with the same 
permission as  the webbserver-user.

Example - List /tmp directory:
http://www.xxxx.nu/fss/index.php?cam=/../../../../../../../../../../
../tmp

To create dirs and delete files simple use the buttons in the 
webbinterface.


[- Code Location -]
The vulnerable code is located in the index.php file. The 
"$_GET['cam']" is the indata that needs to be checked and 
sanitized. 


[- Exploit -]
Not needed.
