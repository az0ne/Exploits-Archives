Description:
 Cross site scripting describes attacks that allow to insert malicious
 html or javascript code via get or post forms. This can be used to steal
 session cookies.
 helma is a javascript-based application server, gobi is a cms
 based on helma. It's used on some popular pages, e. g. the ORF.
 The search-function can be used to inject javascript code.
 It will cause an information disclosure about the system path of helma
 if filled with invalid chars.

Workaround/Fix:
 There's no vendor fix. All input strings in web applications should be
 escaped properly and error messages containing paths should be suppressed
 on live installations.
 Vendor has been contacted 2007-04-12 and hasn't answered yet.
