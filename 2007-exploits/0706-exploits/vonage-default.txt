Vonage VoIP Telephone Adapter Default Misconfiguration

The Vonage VoIP Telephone Adapter device is, by default, accessible from the WLAN/internet. The product ships with the default username of 'user' and default password of 'user' to access the administrative backend.

Users are suggested to update their passwords immediately. An attacker could cause a denial-of-service by uploading broken firmware to the device, or by constantly rebooting the device.
