  DirectAdmin Multiple Cross Site Scripting Vulnerabilities


Control panel for web hosting companies running Red Hat 7.x, 8.x, 9.x,  
Red Hat Enterprise and FreeBSD. This issue is due to a failure in the  
application to properly sanitize user-supplied input. Attackers may  
exploit this issue via a web client. An attacker may leverage this  
issue to have arbitrary script code execute in the browser of an  
unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may help  
the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch  
other attacks. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to  
compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit  
vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
