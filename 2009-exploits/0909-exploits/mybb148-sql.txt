search.php fails to correctly sanitise the user input validation allowing
error based and query based sql injection to discreetly extract
undisclosed information from the sql database

simple query: ' or 1=1--
blind query: ' having 1=1--
must be registered on forum with 2+ posts for this to work :P

solution: simple add a simple sanitiser for $sqlstring and the search
input variable
