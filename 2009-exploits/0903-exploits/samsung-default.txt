Hi @all,

the Samsung G3210 and probably other versions also, offers a FTP-Server with
the default user "ftpuser" and passwort "ftpuser". After login to the router
it's possible to change in various directory e.g "/tmp. Now you can easyly
download the configuration of the router. The file "rc.conf.tmp" contains
the cleartext password of the internet provider (often freenet). If the ftp
account is not enabled, then look for a modded version with web-interface
and the default password "BANANA", then you can enable it.  ;-)

P.S.
Lycos rocks forever! ;-)
